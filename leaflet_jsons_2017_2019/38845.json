I am determined to see greater investment in our police force. I am determined to protect the beautiful environment that we have in Hallam by levelling up our economy, tackling the scourge of fly-tipping and building more homes. Being born and bred in Sheffield Hallam, I know the challenges that face us. Inspired by talking to you, I am passionate about our future, making sure we are supporting our young people on an orderly Brexit."
