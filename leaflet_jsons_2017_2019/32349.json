As a local mum I know that Tory cuts have had a huge impact on everyday life round here. We desperately need change for our communities. We need an MP that fights for local people, not someone who nods through cuts to Yorkshire families while the South continues to prosper. The Tory record is clear: Schools in Morley and Outwood have been cut by \u00a317 million And 4,000 children across the constituency are identified as living in poverty. The NHS is facing the worst winter crisis on record We have lost 1,600 GPs under the Tories and waiting times are through the roof. Crime is soaring as police numbers are slashed The Tories have axed over 20,000 police and violent crime has doubled. A crisis in care and older people facing isolation Our care system is not fit for purpose and free TV licences and bus passes are facing the axe. The Tories are simply not on our side. Towns and communities like ours have a choice to make, more years of neglect and Tory austerity or a Labour Government investing to make our local areas thrive again. Only Labour can beat the Tories here in Morley and Outwood. I hope I can count on your support."
