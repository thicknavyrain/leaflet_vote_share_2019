Nick Tulloch is picking up the votes of Labour and Lib Dem supporters who know they have no chance in this seat but won't give up giving the SNP a free ride. So they are voting with the Scottish Conservatives to stop another unwanted and divisive independence referendum by voting for Scottish Conservative and Unionist at this election. The facts of this election are clear. Labour are in a mess. Divided and in third place across Scotland, they can't take on the SNP. And the Lib Dems are too weak to challenge them. The facts locally are clear too. Labour and the Lib Dems are out of the General Election race here. So only a vote for my candidate can beat the SNP and send Nicola Sturgeon a message she can't ignore. It all adds up to one thing. If you want to say NO to a second independence referendum and for the SNP to get back to growing our economy and make our area more vibrant, vote for Scottish Conservatives. The only party that can beat the SNP here in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch & Strathspey."
