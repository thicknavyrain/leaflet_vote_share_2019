But just remember the opinion polls got the General Election wrong in 2015. They got the EU referendum wrong, and as Jeremy Corbyn has said himself, he was a 200-1 outside chance for the Labour leadership. So in the days of shock election results and global uncertainty, no one can ever really be sure who will win."

A vote for the Liberal Democrats, or any other party in the Southport constituency, is a wasted vote. All it will do is deliver a hung parliament and end in chaos, giving Jeremy Corbyn a route to becoming Prime Minister. So the only way to back me is by voting Conservative in your local constituency of Southport. A vote to back me is a vote for strong and stable leadership in the national interest. And your interests, too. A vote to back me is a vote to strengthen my negotiating position, to ensure we get the best Brexit deal possible. And a vote to back me is a vote to guarantee our economic security for the future. So Aline, please give me your backing and your vote. Together we can get on with the job of making life better for all of us."
