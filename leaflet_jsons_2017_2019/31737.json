I spent many years working for Oxfam, the Child Poverty Action Group and a trade union, and I now work in the health sector. I believe in Labour\u2019s fundamental principles. By working together and pooling our strengths, we can create a better society. The last ten years have seen growing poverty while a very small number of people have got extremely rich. I don\u2019t think this makes for a happier society. We need to look out for each other. We need a voice in Westminster that stands up for our schools, our transport, our businesses and our health service."
