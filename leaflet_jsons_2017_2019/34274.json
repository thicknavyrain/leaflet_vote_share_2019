The Lib Dems are committed to stopping Brexit and investing in public services instead.\n- I will hold the Council to account to ensure potholes are fixed, fly tipping stops and public money is not wasted. I will ensure that Southern and Thameslink services are reliable, and public transport is made safe and accessible for everyone.\nI look around the streets where I live and know they can be better. If you agree then make sure you vote to be your MP and build a better future in Mitcham and Morden."
