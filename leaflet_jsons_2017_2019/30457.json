I care passionately about our community and put Crawley first. I have a record of listening to constituents and raising their issues in Parliament. The re-election of a Conservative Government is vital to ensure a strong economy and continued standing up for our community. I am proud of achieving extra funding for Crawley schools, services rebuilding Crawley Hospital, creating further well paid jobs and support to Crawley businesses at Manor Royal Business District. Experience is vital and record of delivery matters. My campaign for a further referendum on the EU should the circumstances change to reflect the views of Crawley voters. Experience matters and I hope to continue as your local MP. A vote for Theresa May ensures strong leadership in the Brexit negotiations, ensuring Crawley's future prosperity. Yours sincerely, Henry Smith"
