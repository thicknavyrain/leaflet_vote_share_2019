I am a classical musician - pianist, conductor, solo tenor and I teach piano locally. My leafleting invention won Best New Business in the 2017 Bucks SME Business Awards. Passionate about politics since schooldays, I served you as a Chiltern District Councillor 1999-2015 and as a County Councillor 2001-09. During this time I organised a petition of over 8K singers and instrumentalists which played a major part in having detrimental to many voluntary-run organisations church licensing proposals withdrawn from the Licensing Act 2003. I upgraded to UKIP in 2013 disillusioned that the Conservative Party had deserted their core values of economic and protecting the Greenbelt, as manifested by HS2 and, contrary to expectations introduced. Local councillors folding powers, reducing local controls and accountability.",
