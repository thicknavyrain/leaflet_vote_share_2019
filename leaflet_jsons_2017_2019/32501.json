Parliament spent the last three years going round in circles - agreeing on nothing except more arguments. Don't you think it's time to get on with the country's priorities? Don't you think it's time to stop arguing about the past and start building the kind of future we want? A future where you don't have to wait three weeks for a GP appointment - because our NHS has the extra funding it needs to thrive. A future where your streets are safe no matter where you live - because our Police have the officers they need to get a grip on crime. A future where your children have a world-class education - because no school is underfunded or left behind. This is the kind of future we can create together. It's just within our grasp. So let's put the last three years behind us. Let's get a parliament that works for you. We'll get Brexit done with our deal that's ready to go from day one of a new parliament. It protects jobs and trade - with no more dither or delay. Then we can get on with the country\u2019s priorities that we all share. Better hospitals. Safer streets. World-class schools. And a growing economy. We can unleash Britain's potential. But it starts with you. At this election, vote to get on with the country's priorities. Vote Conservative."
