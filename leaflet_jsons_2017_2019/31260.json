Whether you voted to leave or remain in 2016, I hope you will agree that the democratic decision that was taken, and which the then Government promised to implement, has to be honoured if we are to uphold the best traditions of British democracy. We need to make Brexit happen, and do so in a way that protects the jobs and livelihoods of our citizens. That's what the new Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration Boris Johnson negotiated with the EU does. That is why I support it."
