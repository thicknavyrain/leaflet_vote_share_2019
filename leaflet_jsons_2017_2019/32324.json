I was grateful and humbled by the support residents had shown, and for their clear rejection of the Conservative Brexit agenda.\nSince then, the Labour Party I joined has let down millions of its own supporters, by aiding and abetting the Conservatives on Brexit. The party has become one that tolerates anti-Jewish racism, and a culture of bullying.\nI just couldn\u2019t stay with Labour.\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to rid the Labour Party of anti-semitism and his dereliction of duty on Brexit, the biggest national crisis in a generation, compelled me to leave the Labour Party.\nI realised that the best way to fight for the future of our country and protect our membership of the EU was to join the Liberal Democrats. And so in June I became one of 26,000 to join the Liberal Democrats in the last 6 months.\nThe local and European elections earlier this year showed that people are ready to get behind the most consistent, credible, strongest Remain party in British politics - the Liberal Democrats. And in this year\u2019s elections, Labour voters rightly abandoned Jeremy Corbyn in their droves.\nAt the General Election this December I urge you to vote Liberal Democrat. We have an ambitious plan for the future of our country, where every person, every community and our planet can thrive."
