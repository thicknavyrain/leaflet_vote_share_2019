                "content": "The NHS may be the envy of the world, but our mental health service is not. People are struggling. When they turn for help, it is often not there. Waiting times for mental health services are, on average, 14 weeks - just for an assessment - before support and care has even begun. Problems that can start small, become crises as help is either not available, or arrives late. The Liberal Democrats have a plan to tackle this. They have pledged to ringfence funding for mental health and put extra investment into services. They will also ensure services run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Liberal Democrats will increase mental health staffing and will ensure that, by 2025, 100% of children and young people with diagnosable conditions get NHS treatment. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson said: 'For years, mental health has been overlooked by Conservative and Labour governments. My government will ensure these patients no longer face shamefully long waiting times and are treated with the same care as those with physical illnesses. We will ensure our mental health services are available to everyone who needs them.'"
