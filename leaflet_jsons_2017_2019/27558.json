While there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we don't get Brexit right, the consequences will be serious. If we don't get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply not happen."

But there are only two people who can possibly be Prime Minister after the election to negotiate Brexit \u2013 me or Jeremy Corbyn. Labour under Jeremy Corbyn are a shambles and he would embarrass Britain in Brussels and risk our economic security."
