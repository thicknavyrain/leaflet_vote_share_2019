Issues such as protecting the green belt and village conservation areas from inappropriate planning applications, securing investment in road and pavement repairs and tackling speeding and parking problems in our area. The general election now gives us a real opportunity to address some of the issues that we can\u2019t solve locally, but can only be fixed in Westminster \u2013 issues such as the underfunding of our local schools and hospitals, a lack of action in protecting our environment and ensuring the promises on dualling the outer ring road are fulfilled. You will shortly receive your postal vote for the upcoming General Election \u2013 this is your opportunity to choose your next MP. We are writing to ask for your support for the Liberal Democrat candidate in the General Election. We both know Keith Aspden well, he is a fellow councillor in York Outer and as council leader following the elections in May, he has been instrumental in helping us to get things done for the villages of Rural West York Ward. With Keith backing our community on the national stage, we\u2019ll be able to achieve even more for our area. With your support, we hope to soon have an MP who will work hard for our community. Kind regards, Anne E James Anne Hook & James Barker Liberal Democrat Councillors for Rural West York Ward PS. The election here in York Outer will be a close race between Keith Aspden\u2019s Liberal Democrats and the Conservative candidate. A vote for the Labour Party will just help the Conservatives win here."
