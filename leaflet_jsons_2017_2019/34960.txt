When looking at the recent election polls one thing is clear - this General Election is going to be a memorable one."

Whether the Conservative or the Liberal Democrat wins will come down to how many Labour supporters lend their vote to the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats have the best chance to win seats from the Conservatives, keeping them from a majority. But only if enough Labour supporters back the Liberal Democrats this time. With the Green Party standing aside to support the Liberal Democrat candidates in many areas, it is pretty clear how many people that don't want the Conservatives to win are now backing. You know from previous elections that a vote for anyone other the Liberal Democrats can end up with a Conservative MP."
