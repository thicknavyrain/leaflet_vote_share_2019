                "content": "I joined the Conservative Party in the 1990s. I was a Minister in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, but I quit on a point of principle earlier this year. Leaving the Conservative Party was not easy, but it was the right thing to do. The Conservative Party no longer has a place for people like me. Boris Johnson cares more about himself than the future of our country: he has lied to people, lied to Parliament and lied to the Queen. He has led his party to the extreme. The Conservative Party has drifted away from One Nation values and towards English nationalism. A vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s party is essentially a vote for Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. It is clear to me that the Liberal Democrats are best placed to forge a new liberal movement on the big issues of our time. If, like me, you are simply horrified by the direction Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives are taking, please use your vote to support the Liberal Democrats in your area this time. This is a crucial time for the future of our country. The Liberal Democrats are the clear force to fight against the extremism of the two main parties. If you back the values of tolerance and openness, join me in sending a message with your vote \u2013 and voting Liberal Democrat. Your vote can make a real difference."
