This snap general election is a response to the politics of the past, a politics in which the government holds the country hostage to a small, self-interested, ideological sub group in parliament. With our focus on solving the housing crisis, fighting for young people and having a say in the Brexit deal, the Green Party is standing up to this self-serving politicking. There really is a better way."
