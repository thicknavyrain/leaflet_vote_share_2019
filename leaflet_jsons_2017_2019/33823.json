I have seen the impact of the Tory government cuts to our public services and how this has impacted on hard working people and families. A Labour government will change this. Our NHS, Not. For. Sale! \u2013 It has been revealed, that the NHS is on the table for the US-UK trade deal, with \u201ceverything included\u201d. That\u2019s a green light for breaking open Britain\u2019s public services so corporations can profit from them and your health! What will that mean for you? Let\u2019s compare the price of medicine. The drug Humira for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis costs our NHS \u00a31,409 a packet. In the US, the same packet costs \u00a38,115. We cannot let our hard-won rights, protections and freedoms erode by allowing Donald Trump to get his hands on our country. Labour will not let this happen. Unlike the Conservatives, we\u2019re not on the side of the billionaires and bankers.
