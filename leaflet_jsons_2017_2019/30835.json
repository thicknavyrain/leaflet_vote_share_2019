It\u2019s clear we cannot trust a word she says.\n\nI have been privileged to serve the people of Gedling for 20 years now and I am standing again as your Labour candidate in the election on 8th June.\n\nMuch has changed over those 20 years and throughout I have worked hard for our community. I have stood up to Tory cuts to our schools, NHS and public services. I have also made a stand against the hard Brexit the Tories intend on pursuing.\n\nThis election, in Gedling, will be a choice between me or a Tory. Of course, other parties will stand but in the end the choice here in Gedling is clear - me or a Tory.\n\nThis election is a choice about the values we have and the future we want as a country. I will always fight for the people of Gedling, even in the face of a Tory Prime Minister who breaks promises and seems hellbent on giving more to the rich while letting down local working people and families and those who need a helping hand.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am asking for your continued support."
