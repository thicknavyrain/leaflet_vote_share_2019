We want to create a fairer, more equal country so everyone can live a fulfilled, happy life. A Liberal Democrat government will provide free childcare for all children of working parents from 9 months old. We\u2019ll close the gap between the rich and poor. The standard of free childcare provision will rise too, so that every child gets a fair chance in life. The Liberal Democrats will help everyone develop the skills needed to succeed throughout life."

We will also improve access to training and increase staff numbers so that everyone who needs help can get it. We will provide extra funding so that children and young people, as well as adults, have access to good mental health support."
