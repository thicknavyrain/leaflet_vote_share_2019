We have seen this in larger class sizes, fewer teachers, ancient IT equipment and school staff; begging letters for funds for basic equipment and books. Some schools can't even afford to open on Fridays... In Rushcliffe, 33 schools have suffered cuts, with a total shortfall of \u00a33.8M. The cuts to our schools are deeply unfair. We should never stop fighting for our children's future. We will campaign for fairer funding for our children and grandchildren until every school is properly resourced to give each child the education they deserve. Labour will make sure schools are properly resourced with increased funding formulas that leaves no child worse off. We will invest in upgrade classrooms, hire more teachers, and give teachers a pay rise."

                "content": "A decade of Tory health cuts and privatisation has pushed our nation's greatest institution to the brink. Staff are under record stress, NHS waiting times and patient complaints are at record levels, and many hospital buildings are inadequate and crumbling. There are 100,000 staff vacancies in NHS England, including 43,000 nurse vacancies, and over 15,000 doctor vacancies. Tory cuts have reduced the number of health visitors by over 2,000 since 2015. Conservative privatisation is also making the NHS raise a black alert with over 4.4 million people now on hospital waiting lists. Labour will end NHS privatisation. Our mission is to eradicate injustice, to transform and save lives through morning sickness to longer life and a healthier life."
