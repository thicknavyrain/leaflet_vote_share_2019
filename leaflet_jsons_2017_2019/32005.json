In 2016, 58.3 percent of our area voted to leave the EU. But more than three years on we still haven't left, and it's not just Brexit. For too many years, the political class has taken our support for granted. Our town needs to increase police numbers and support services to safeguard everyone within the community. As your MP I would make sure that Ipswich gets the investment it deserves. Vote for me to Change Politics for Good."
