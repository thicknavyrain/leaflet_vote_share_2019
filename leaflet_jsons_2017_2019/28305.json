We campaign throughout the year. We back local residents and groups at every opportunity. Our councillors at all levels of local government listen and respond to everyone that contacts them. Shouldn't all our elected representatives do this? We can bring the change that is desperately needed, but not without your help. Without change at the ballot box, the Tories will feel they have a mandate to continue cutting funding from front-line services and concreting over our open spaces and countryside."
