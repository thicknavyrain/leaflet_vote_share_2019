Waiting times for mental health services are, on average, 14 weeks - just for an assessment - before support and care has even begun. Problems that can start small, become crises as help is either not available, or arrives late. The Liberal Democrats have a plan to tackle this. They have pledged to ringfence funding for mental health and put extra investment into services. They will also ensure services run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Liberal Democrats will increase mental health staffing and will ensure that, by 2025, 100% of children and young people with diagnosable conditions get NHS treatment."
