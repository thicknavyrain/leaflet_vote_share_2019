It was one of the toughest things I’ve ever had to do, but I couldn’t stay quiet any longer.\n\nOne of our proudest institutions is being damaged by a desperate quest for privatisation by Theresa May’s Conservatives.\n\nOur beloved NHS is at breaking point.\n\nThis winter saw the worst-ever crisis for A&E departments. 1.2 million of our elderly people are not getting the care they need. 15% of operations are cancelled.\n\nWe cannot let this vandalism go on any longer. That’s why I am campaigning for the Liberal Democrats in this election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are the only party to set out a clear plan to fund the NHS. A penny on income tax for the NHS will ease the pressure on NHS staff and patients until long-term solutions can be found.\n\nThe future of the NHS is in your hands.\n\nFive more years of Theresa May’s Conservatives will give them free reign for more and more NHS cuts. Only a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote of confidence in our NHS.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr Clare Gerada\n\nPS - As an NHS doctor, I am fearful of the damage that would be done to the NHS by an all-powerful Conservative government. At this election, the future of our NHS is in your hands."
