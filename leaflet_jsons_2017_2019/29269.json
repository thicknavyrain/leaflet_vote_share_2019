As your new SNP Councillors get to work on your behalf, I know our new City Government will transform our city for the better in the months and years ahead.\n\nAs your SNP candidate for the Glasgow South constituency, I hope I can count on your continued support for the snap election on 8th June.\n\nI was elected two years ago as the first ever SNP MP for the Glasgow South constituency and since then I have done my best to stand up for you in parliament and be a diligent local MP here in the constituency.\n\nAs the Prime Minister takes us towards an increasingly difficult Brexit, it is vital that our area has an MP who will stand up for jobs and workers rights, propose the nuclear threat posed by Trident and the worst excesses of this hard-right Tory Government the UK Government is pursuing.\n\nThere\u2019s also another extremely important issue at stake in this election and that is the future of both Langside and Castlemilk Job Centres which the Tories want to close. Since the announcement last year, I have worked tirelessly with politicians of different parties, trade unions and community campaigners to help keep our Job Centres open and local. The election means that the decision has been put on hold until after polling day.\n\nBy re-electing me as your MP you will be making it crystal clear to the UK Government that their attack on Glasgow\u2019s Job Centres is unacceptable, and my promise to you is that I will continue to fight these closures every step of the way. As the Tories look set to win a big majority at this election, it is vital you have an MP who can be relied upon to stand up for Scotland.\n\nI have shown in my first two years that I\u2019m not afraid to stand up for you and tell it like it is at Westminster. On the 8th of June, I need your support to help me continue this work.\n\nMy promise to you is that I will continue to be a strong voice for Scotland, for Glasgow and for the Southside."
