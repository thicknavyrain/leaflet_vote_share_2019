Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, the choice in this election is stark... The main opposition party, who would undoubtedly be supported by the smaller parties, has a manifesto that would compromise our standing in the world and contains a number of uncosted, fantastical policies... A brighter future for our community, country, and children... Let\u2019s get Brexit done."
