                "content": "Dear\nEarlier this year, I left the Conservative Party because it had shifted beyond recognition. It is now in the grip of its right-wing and has no room for moderate views. It has also abandoned any serious commitment to tackling burning injustices.\n\nI just couldn\u2019t stay with the Conservative Party.\n\nIts relentless determination to push ahead with Brexit, no matter what the cost, has divided the country and put so much at risk. Urgent problems - like climate change, widening inequality, the lack of affordable housing and our overstretched NHS \u2013 have been neglected.\n\nThe prospect of No-Deal Brexit has already put our economy in reverse, making it even harder for so many in our country. And ultimately, Boris Johnson only cares about himself, not the future of the UK.\n\nThat\u2019s why earlier this year, like 26,000 others in the last 6 months, I joined the Liberal Democrats. Under Jo Swinson, a Liberal Democrat government will create a shared vision for the country we want to be, where every single person and community is valued, empowered and cared for, and where we protect our planet for future generations.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats will reinvent the relationship between business and the communities in which they operate, so that they are a part of the solution to our biggest challenges, not the problem.\n\nThe local and European elections showed that people are ready to get behind the most consistent, credible, leading Remain party force in British politics - the Liberal Democrats.\n\nAt the General Election this December I urge you to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\nKind regards,\n\nSarah Wollaston\n\nPS. If Remainers come together, we can combat the hatred and division at the extremes of the Conservative and Labour parties. We can build a brighter future."
