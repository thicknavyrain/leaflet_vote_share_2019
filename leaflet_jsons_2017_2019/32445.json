Waiting times for mental health services are, on average, 14 weeks - just for an assessment - before support and care can even begin. Problems that can start small, become crises as help is either not available, or arrives late. The Liberal Democrats have a plan to tackle this. They will have people to provide funding and investment into services. They will also ensure services run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Liberal Democrats will increase mental health staffing and will ensure that, by 2025, 100% of children and young people with diagnosable conditions get NHS treatment. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson said: 'For many years, mental health has been overlooked by Conservative and Labour governments. My government will ensure these patients no longer face shamefully long waiting times and are treated with the same care as those with physical illnesses. We will ensure our mental health services are there for everyone who needs them.'"
