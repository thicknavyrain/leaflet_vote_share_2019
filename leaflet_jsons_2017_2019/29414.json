They already face extra costs (and suffer extra red tape) when they buy goods and services abroad and staff from overseas. As an engineer, I know Peterborough industry and retailers already trade around the world. We don\u2019t need to add uncertainty to international suppliers or markets. We can take back control and avoid UKIP-style Brexit. We need someone who understands what we can realistically get from the EU, where I\u2019ve won and grown engineering standards to make our railways cheaper and our exports flow."

We will increase education spending, especially in \u2018early years\u2019 learning. We need an education system that focuses on every student achieving their best, for example by introducing national teacher pay scales and reversing the current broken system of governance, with more mental health and stimulated spending on reducing air quality levels. So we\u2019ll reverse Conservative cuts, reinstating universal credit, abolishing bedroom tax and raising benefits for 18-24 year olds. Crucially, we need a culture that values our healthcare professionals and teachers properly. So we will abolish the 1% limit on public sector pay rises and reform Ofsted to cut unnecessary work for teachers."
