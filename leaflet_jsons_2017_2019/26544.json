Theresa May has the strength of character to achieve this and bring the country together as we build a new relationship with our friends in Europe and around the world.\nYour vote for the Conservatives will help reform our economy so that it works for everyone; maintain our progress in reducing the deficit while increasing funding for the NHS; and focus our energies on building a better and more secure future for our children and grandchildren.\nYour vote for the Conservatives is also to keep the strong, effective and trusted local leadership that Richard Fuller has demonstrated since being elected.\nThe choice at this election is between strong and stable leadership in the national interest with Theresa May and the Conservatives \u2013 or weak and unstable coalition government led by Jeremy Corbyn."
