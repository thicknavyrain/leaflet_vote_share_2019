Nicola Sturgeon promised a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 referendum on independence would be held in a generation. But she has gone back on her word, and just last year held another divisive, unwanted campaign. Rather than listen to residents who don\u2019t want her referendum, she has now said that her demand for another will be at the heart of her campaign. She wants to use this election to push even harder for an unwanted, divisive referendum on independence. So, unless people stand up to the SNP, we face yet more constitutional division and yet more uncertainty over our future."
