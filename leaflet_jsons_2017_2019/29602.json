Despite being a lifelong Conservative and the Conservative candidate for Sheffield Hallam in the 2001 General Election, I asked you to put party allegiances aside and vote for Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Clegg. For five years Nick Clegg worked alongside Conservatives in the Coalition Government for the good of our country, getting our economy back on track after the financial crisis, and the mess Labour left behind. This time the choice is no less stark. In 2015, the Labour candidate was more than 3,353 votes off winning Sheffield Hallam. Despite roumors at the time that the Conservatives would be a contender in the race, they didn't even come close. It is clearer than ever before that the only party that can challenge Labour's dominance in Sheffield is the Liberal Democrats. Conservatives in Sheffield Hallam have a choice. We can stick to our narrow party interests and vote for a Tory candidate who won't win, or we can back Nick Clegg to stop Jeremy Corbyn's Labour candidate from turning the only non-Labour constituency in South Yorkshire red. Therefore, I urge you, to vote for Nick Clegg on June 8th and help to maintain an alternative voice for Sheffield."
