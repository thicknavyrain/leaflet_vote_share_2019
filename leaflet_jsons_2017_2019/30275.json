I've been a teaching assistant in local schools and have worked and volunteered with local charities, churches, arts and parents' groups. Like you, I've seen the disastrous effect that austerity policies have had on our jobs, schools, hospitals and social care. I'm standing as your Labour candidate to call a halt to politics-as-usual. It's time for change. Our children need to have the best education they can, to be able to afford decent homes and to have secure health care at all ages. I've spoken with many people struggling to make ends meet and fearful about the future. We need to give them, and all of us, something better. I ask you to vote for hope and a real change."
