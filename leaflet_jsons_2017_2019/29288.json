AND government funding for local authorities will stop from 2019. We will have to increase taxes ourselves locally or lose vital public services in Herefordshire and Bromyard. Without the will to back big business, this is an impossible ask. AND the Conservative government says it wants a hard Brexit. But does anyone in their right mind imagine that will improve the cost of leaving Europe. They do not have any idea what it means just as they have no strategy to understand the immediate impact. The Liberal Democrats want to stay in the Single Market for access to jobs and investment and put education, our economy, our environment and the future of our children first."
