And I'll make things fairer for them, by controlling and reducing the number of people who come to Britain when we leave the EU.\nI'll stand up for Britain to keep our economy strong, so we can pay for a strong NHS, a good school place for every child and real technical education for more young people.\nAnd with that strong economy, we can do more to help local families with action to cap unfair energy price rises, introduce new rights and protections for workers and help more people have a home of their own by building more affordable homes."
