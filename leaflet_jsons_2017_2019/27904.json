To shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment. To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services. To put power back in your hands through a citizen\u2019s democracy. Every Green vote on 8 June will help make that vision a reality. If you agree with us, stand with us. The Conservatives think they have this election sewn up. But it\u2019s in your hands. Stand with us for housing, schools, our NHS, our environment, and our future. We stand up for what matters. Vote Green Party on 8 June!"
