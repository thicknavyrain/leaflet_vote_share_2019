Making Brexit a success is central to our national interest \u2013 and it is central to your own security and prosperity. While there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we don\u2019t get Brexit right the consequences will be serious. If we don\u2019t get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply not happen. But with your help Michael Whiting, together we can get it right."

I believe that with dedication and hard work, we can make a success of Brexit and bring our country together - building a stronger economy that creates secure and well-paid jobs, where every child gets a good school place and working people can buy a home of their own. But there are only two people who can possibly be Prime Minister after the election to negotiate Brexit \u2013 me or Jeremy Corbyn. Labour under Jeremy Corbyn are a shambles and he would embarrass Britain in Brussels and risk our economic security. So the choice at this election is clear. Strong and stable leadership with me in the national interest, to see us through Brexit and beyond. Or a hung parliament and coalition of chaos with Jeremy Corbyn."
