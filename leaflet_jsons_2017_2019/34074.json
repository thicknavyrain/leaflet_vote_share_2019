                "content": "As you may know, I have served Winchester & Chandler's Ford as our MP since 2010 and will be standing for the Conservatives once again on Thursday 12th December.\n\nPoliticians always say \u201cthis election is the most important\u201d but this time we might be right. The outcome next month, in seats like this especially, will set the course of our country for many years.\nOf course there are plenty of issues at stake, it is a General Election after all, but we face the first winter poll in a generation because of the stalemate in Westminster around Brexit.\n\nI could not have been clearer and more consistent since 2016 but, for ease and to avoid any doubt, let me summarise where I stand.\n\nWe need to unblock Parliament and move on from this seemingly endless inertia. We won\u2019t do that by constantly re-fighting the 2016 referendum - and tearing our country apart in the process. We can ratify the Withdrawal Agreement Treaty, safely get a new deal, and if I am returned as part of a majority Conservative Government we will.\n\nWe can then focus on the future trading relationship - with our friends in the EU, yes, but also with the 150 or so other countries not members of that bloc - and all the other issues that matter."
