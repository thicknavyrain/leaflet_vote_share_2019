I went to Parmiter's School and won a state to study law at Cambridge University. I live locally with my wife and children. My experiences have taught me the value of hard work. I believe in providing for yourself, your family and serving our community. I am honoured to have had the best of both worlds here in Hertsmere growing up in semi-rural towns and villages, and a strong sense of community that closely associates to London. As Hertsmere's MP for the past four years, I have sought to generate change and improve lives, including experiences appointing a new GP clinic and increasing our funding to our local schools. It would be an honour to be re-elected and have the opportunity to serve you again as your MP."
