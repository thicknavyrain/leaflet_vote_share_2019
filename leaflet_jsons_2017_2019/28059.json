This will have a knock on effect on local businesses, so they can begin to see good trading again, helped by stopping parking charges in Morecambe Town Centre. By returning to being a Seaside resort, bringing the crowds back to Morecambe all the year round including better Christmas lights to welcome visitors. Getting the long overdue repairs made to the roads and pavements. Providing social housing that is affordable for local people & Veterans, giving them a better feeling about the future. Stopping welfare cuts, pension caps, cuts to care home funding which if continued, will result in more closures. Library's only being kept open due to community help. People being stranded in rural areas due to bus routes being cut."
