Parliament was gridlocked with MPs refusing to vote through legislation to honour the referendum result.\nBoris Johnson brought home a deal everyone said would be impossible to achieve, but he did it.\nIt's a fantastic deal that delivers on the promise of 2016, whilst at the same time protecting the rights of citizens and workers, keeps our borders safe and allows us to negotiate free trade deals to grow our economy.\nIt's time to get Brexit done, but that can only happen under a Conservative majority government.\nAs a former nurse and now a Health Minister, who lived in Westoning and Woburn for many years, I'm keen for this to happen in order to benefit Mid-Bedfordshire. We can then focus all our attention onto the NHS, social care, maternity and mental health provision, policing and education. The things that matter to so many.\nI hope to continue to be known as an outspoken MP who has never been afraid to raise your concerns at the highest levels.\nSo, let's do this. Let's get Brexit done and unleash the huge potential this great country has to offer.\nNadine\nNadine Dorries\nYour Conservative Candidate for Mid-Bedfordshire"
