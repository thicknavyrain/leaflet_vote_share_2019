We can offer the EU a free trade deal. If elected I will never support any concession which might allow Human Rights provisions (incorporated into the Lisbon Treaty) being used to prevent foreign criminals being removed from our country. The decision must be made according to our own law. Vote UKIP to show your support for a CLEAN BREXIT.\nYours sincerely, John Scutter"
