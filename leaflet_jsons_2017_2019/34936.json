I'm going to guess that you'd rather the countryside was not concreted over and that we neither return to 1950s culture nor a 1970s economy. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you'd rather not be paying much higher taxes to have your country's law-making outsourced to continental bureaucrats who don't believe in democracy and don't know or care where Nottinghamshire is. If you think I understand you a little better than the current Westminster crowd, you know what to do. Vote for me on Dec 12th. Give yourself a voice that will be heard. Matthew"
