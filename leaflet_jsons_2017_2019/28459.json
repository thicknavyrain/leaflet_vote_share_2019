I voted to Remain and stand firm in my belief that staying in the European Single Market, or retaining as much access as possible, offers the best opportunities for businesses and jobs.\nYour vote matters because our local NHS needs a champion. I have spent years campaigning on health issues, like keeping a fully-staffed maternity unit at Winchester Hospital. I know first-hand how hard doctors and nurses work to keep those services going and how vital they are for you.\nYour vote matters because our children deserve the best possible education. As a parent and a school governor, I have fought against school budget cuts. As your MP, I will continue to fight for our schools and resist any move to force our excellent comprehensive schools to become secondary moderns.\nYour vote matters because our local environment should be protected. Improving road safety, reducing carbon emissions and highlighting traffic hotspots around the city have been a personal mission. I believe in the importance of investing in sustainable energy sources and will work to build a greener economy, both locally and nationally.\nWith decades of experience representing local people and campaigning for the things that matter most to all of us, I understand what people really need from their MP.\nIt only takes one extra vote to win an election. Your vote could make the difference."
