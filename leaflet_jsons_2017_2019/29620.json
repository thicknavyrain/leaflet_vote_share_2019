Labour will give the NHS the resources it needs to serve our country. We will ensure nurses do not have to pay for their training and will increase investment in the mental and physical health. A Labour government will also mount a major programme to improve the health and wellbeing of every child in the country. This will include increasing the Index of Child Health to measure progress against international standards; legally requiring all Government departments to have a child health strategy to set out how they will support the UK\u2019s ambition to make our children healthier than previous generations. We will also make sure nurses and health visitors to make house calls and give families the healthcare they are entitled to. A Labour Government would secure extra funding for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and support for counseling in every school."

But resources in Children\u2019s and Adults\u2019 services are tight, and using fosterers like Andrea and Carol to look after vulnerable children is only part of fostering care. We need compassionate care workers to step up and look after the kids in their homes, to step into chaotic homes where they can live by 15 minute appointments. Labour will end zero hour contracts and give care workers more security. We also need a strong police force to keep our communities safe from crime. We will also take 10,000 new officers over the past seven years and investigate new technology."
