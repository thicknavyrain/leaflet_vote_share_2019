I campaigned proudly during the referendum to remain in the European Union and continue to do so. Our farmers, our hospital and young people locally have all benefited from the EU; we thrive inside Europe. As a charity worker, and from most of my career I have worked on behalf of the most vulnerable: those facing fuel poverty, those struggling with the broken rental system, and those suffering abuse within the home. I want to represent our communities and be the change that benefits us all."
