That means more uncertainty for our economy. With no end to the Brexit arguments. And another Scottish independence referendum. That's not all. Corbyn's plans for our economy would undo the progress of the last few years. The head of the CBI, a business group, said that Corbyn's plans would 'crack the foundations of our economy'. With massive taxes on businesses - which will stop investment and cost jobs. And with \u00a31.2 trillion of extra spending - which will send our public finances back into chaos. Don't let Labour take us back to square one. Vote Conservative and secure the majority government this country needs."
