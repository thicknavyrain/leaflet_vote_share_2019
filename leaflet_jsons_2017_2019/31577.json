When John Pugh and Ronnie Fearn were our MPs, we knew that Southport had a strong voice at Westminster and worked hard for our town.\n\nThat's what you'll get from John Wright. Too many local residents tell us that they think the MP isn't doing his job.\n\nWe all need help from time to time and an MP should be there for all residents.\n\nJohn Wright will revive the liberal tradition of having an open door policy to help people with casework.\n\nJohn will campaign hard on the issues that matter to local people - reviving our town centre, safeguarding our hospital, and getting better public services.\n\nOur Conservative MP promised a lot but what has he really achieved in the last 2 and a half years? Has having a Conservative MP made anything better?"

Trump does not understand the special place it has in our hearts. He only ever thinks about the money.'\n\nThe NHS needs our support now more than ever. That's why we need an honest plan to fund the service. We will put 1p on the pound in income tax to ensure the NHS has the funding it needs for the future.\n\nWe will also reform the social care system so that no-one needs to sell their home to pay for care. All parties seemed to have agreed on this until the Conservatives removed their support for the cross-party plan."
