I wasn\u2019t always political but like many, after the Iraq war, I was left with so many questions about politics in the UK. Questions like, what makes democracy work for the people, not just the powerful? I am passionate about community, the environment, equality, the NHS, animals and education. I often feel so inspired by what could be possible, how the country can be transformed for the good of all, not just the few. I see a country where we have clean air, renewable energy, we look after our environment, we care for the vulnerable, have meaningful and secure work and where everyone gets the opportunity to thrive and fulfil their potential. I know this is possible but I also know it can only be achieved together."
