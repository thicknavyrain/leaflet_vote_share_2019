I joined the Labour Party as a teenager, I was a councillor and an adviser to the last Labour government.\nThe Labour Party has been my life and until this year I could never have dreamt of voting for anyone else. It really has come to something when I can no longer ask you to vote Labour.\nI could never ask anyone to make Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister: I am decent, traditional Labour, but I think he is completely unfit to lead our country.\nThe Labour Party has been poisoned by racism, extremism and intolerance under his leadership.\nI do not believe Jeremy Corbyn loves this country or that he and the people around him can be trusted with our defence and security. They always seem to back people who hate Britain - whether that\u2019s the IRA, terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah or even parroting Putin\u2019s propaganda when he tried to murder people here in Britain. And when we had the chance to take out ISIS, Jeremy Corbyn refused to back any action.\nNo-one thinks he will deliver Brexit and at a time when working people need support, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have come up with plans that will put businesses, investment and jobs at risk.\nI know how hard it is for Labour voters to back the Tories, but at the end of this election, either Boris Johnson will be Prime Minister \u2013 or Jeremy Corbyn. That's the choice.\nAnd I am worried that if Boris Johnson does not get a majority, the SNP will back Corbyn.\nIt is too big a risk. That is why I think we should lend the Tories our votes and stop Jeremy Corbyn getting anywhere near Downing Street.\nThis hasn't been an easy decision. But it\u2019s the right one. And I encourage you to vote the same way."
