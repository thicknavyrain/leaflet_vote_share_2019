And they will be felt by ordinary, working people across the country. If we don\u2019t get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply not happen.\nBut with your help James, and your vote locally in the Bury North constituency, together we can get it right."
