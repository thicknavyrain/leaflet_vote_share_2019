But MK Labour\u2019s reckless growth plans would mean we get swallowed up by over-development \u2013 Labour would make Newport Pagnell just another suburb of Milton Keynes. I am actively fighting MK Labour and Lib Dem plans to build thousands of houses to the east of the M1. Milton Keynes does need to grow, but growth should be sustainable, and its impact managed properly. Labour is out of touch and out of ideas and is using Newport Pagnell and our local public services that will pay the price for this over development. Join me in standing up for Newport Pagnell and bringing a sensible approach to growth in MK - Vote Conservative on 12th December. A vote for any other party could sabotage all our good work in the area, so on 12th December, vote Ben Everitt to make Milton Keynes North a great place to live, work and enjoy."
