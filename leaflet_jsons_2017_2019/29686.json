We are a centre radical libertarian one-nation party that wants change. Our members come from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, united in the common objective of getting Britain out of the European Union. However now that the Referendum has been won, people are asking what's next for UKIP? First a full Brexit has to be delivered, but then it is important to understand that Brexit is only the gateway to our salvation. It all depends on how we use it."
