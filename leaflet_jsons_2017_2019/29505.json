Twickenham schools are under unprecedented pressure to cut costs. Housing costs are rising due to lack of supply. A Labour government will deliver growth by investing in homes and infrastructure, creating jobs and raising wages. It will invest in our children and protect school funding. Voters in Twickenham need a better choice than the Tories and their former coalition partners the Lib Dems. Labour offers a real alternative."
