We are fighting to give YOU a say on the final deal, for the rights of EU citizens and to stay in the single market.\n\nTheresa May is determined to sever our relationship with the EU in the most destructive way possible - regardless of the consequences to our economy, our jobs, our NHS, you and future generations. But it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nEveryone agrees that the Tories will win this UK general election. Labour have no hope. This election is our chance to send a message. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote against hard Brexit.\n\nThis constituency is my home. I want to give back to our communities the voice we have been denied for too long. If I earn your vote and return as your MP \u2013 a job I loved and cherished for 32 years \u2013 I promise you will not feel ignored."
