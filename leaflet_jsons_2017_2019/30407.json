On 8th June, you face an important choice that will have real consequences for your family, for our city and for our country - a strong Government led by Theresa May, or the threat of a weak and unstable coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn. I moved to Southampton to attend the University, and having worked here for most of my adult life, I understand the challenges facing the city and the problems local people encounter every day. My plan for Southampton addresses these concerns. With a strong Government and a dedicated local MP, I think we can make things better in Southampton for everyone. My plan for Southampton includes five commitments to you. The choice at this election is clear; backing Theresa May and myself you will be voting for the best deal for Britain and a brighter future for Southampton. I very much hope that I can count on your support on June 8th."
