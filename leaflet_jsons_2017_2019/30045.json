My roots on Teesside go back generations. I have lived here all my life and I share the passion of thousands of local people for our proud history and our bright future. Don\u2019t believe the politicians when they tell you this election is just about Brexit. Of course, we need to make sure we get the best possible deal when we leave the EU, putting our area first and protecting local jobs. This election is also about saving our NHS, creating opportunities for our area, investing in our children\u2019s futures and providing the best services for our elderly. 18 months ago, we were hit badly by the loss of our steelworks but this election is an opportunity to build a positive future for Teesside, bringing jobs and investment to an area which has been neglected for far too long. I have already been speaking up for local people for nearly six years on the council. Let\u2019s take the fight to Westminster on 8 June. With thanks and best wishes, Josh Mason"
