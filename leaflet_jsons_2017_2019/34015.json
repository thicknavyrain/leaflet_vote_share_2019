Like many of you, I believe the established parties are no longer fit for purpose. Husband and father of dual-national children, I do not feel there is a contradiction between having a positive international outlook, and wanting the UK to be free of undemocratic EU rule. In Leyton and Wanstead I want to fight for the very best public services, safe streets and an economy that works for us all.",
