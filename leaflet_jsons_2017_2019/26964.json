On health, Julian gained an extra \u00a320 million for local NHS services and secured funding to get Papworth Hospital moved to the city's Addenbrooke's site. On schools, he fought to win an additional \u00a323.2 million every year to help Cambridgeshire children. On transport, Julian successfully fought for the new Cambridge North station and Chisholm Trail cycle and pedestrian route.
