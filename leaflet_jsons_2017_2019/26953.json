If I\u2019m chosen to be your MP, I will champion Calder Valley and the different communities and concerns within it, and push for the change we need. This is one of the most important elections in a generation. The stakes couldn't be higher. We have to ensure we protect our economy, our rights at work and our region in the upcoming Brexit negotiations. We must make a stand for proper jobs and investment in the North of England. With my work with a Christian anti-poverty charity and as a local councillor, I\u2019ve seen the effects of the needless and vicious austerity measures imposed by the current government. When our nurses are having to visit food banks to survive, things have spiralled out of control. No more! I will fight for Calder Valley as an MP. For our schools, for our health service, for the protection of our community against floods. Frankly, the people of our valley have been poorly served, at best, by our current Conservative MP. It\u2019s time for that to change."
