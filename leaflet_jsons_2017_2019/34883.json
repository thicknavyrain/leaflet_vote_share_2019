And it is also no surprise what her price for that support will be another referendum on Scottish independence, as early as next year.\nOf course, there's a school of thought that says it would never happen. Surely no Westminster government would give Nicola Sturgeon that referendum."

That's how important the result in Scottish constituencies could be again.\nSo I hear why some people are thinking hard about how they will vote this time. I completely get it.\nBut the fact is that if you want to beat the SNP here and make certain we aren't facing a hung parliament on 13th December, with Nicola Sturgeon in the driving seat, your vote - even if it is only this time - needs to be for the Scottish Conservatives. It's the only way to be sure.\nYours sincerely,\nRuth Davidson"
