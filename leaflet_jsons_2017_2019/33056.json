No wonder I am meeting so many disillusioned former Labour voters on the doorstep. Only a Conservative vote will guarantee our exit from the EU. No other party has a deal in place. Let's get Brexit done in January so that we can heal divisions and focus on building a better future for Easington and our families. Elect me as your next MP and I will fight for Easington. I will fight for the investment, jobs and regeneration that you deserve. No longer will we have to suffer the damage caused by decades of Labour neglect. In Westminster I am more than a paper power and I can guarantee that no ear will go unbent and no arm untwisted to deliver my plan for Easington. Elect me as your next MP to represent the people and work hard for you. Together we can realize Easington's potential. Best Wishes, Clare Ambrosino, Conservative Parliamentary Candidate"
