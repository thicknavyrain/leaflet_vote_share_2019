A record-beating \u00a314 billion funding increase has been announced by the Prime Minister after Geoffrey made the case for extra funding in Westminster and Whitehall, allowing for a 15% budget increase in the next 3 years. Schools in Torridge and West Devon will receive one of the largest rises, an immediate 5% under a Conservative Government, rising further to \u00a35,267 per pupil in local primary schools and \u00a35,433 per secondary school pupil in 2020-21. This huge extra injection of funds into local schools means finally reversing decades of Devon\u2019s underfunding. Children with special education-needs and disabilities will get a separate package worth \u00a3700 million to make sure extra support is available for those who need it most. After listening to parents and teachers in his regular visits to local schools, Geoffrey made powerful arguments to ensure the case was heard. Geoffrey said: 'Responsible economic management means we can give this boost to our schools, putting education at the heart of our plan for government.'"
