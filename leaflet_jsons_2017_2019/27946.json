Abercynon Primary School and Aberdare Community School were identified as specific cases. Key staged three tests performance has put former mining valleys at the top of the league table, something which favours the economy. The Assembly of South Wales agreed to allocate \u00a3500,000 towards appeal for more and better-trained headteachers for the local schools, according to existing plans. Cynon council expects Life-long learning conservative program so that it will favour all residents. The decision to introduce Homework compact supports and will help pupils to improve their skills in meeting these challenges is imperative."

The same was true when there was a landslide in 1983, it changed the history resulting in poor housing with cuts in welfare. This will devastate our communities in the same way, so we need hope and investment, not devastation and disdain."
