The redoubling of the Swindon to Kemble line will mean more direct trains from Cheltenham to Swindon, Reading and London and a much more reliable service. The campaign was backed by MPs and councillors of all parties along with local businesses."

This will mean cuts in public spending and our local NHS has now been told to expect no increases for years to come. But because of staff pay promises and the rising cost of treatment, no increase could mean real cuts. Martin has promised local doctors and nurses he will fight to defend a free, local NHS and called for cuts to fall on multi-billion plans for nuclear missiles and regional bureaucracies, not frontline local health services like A&E or maternity."

Legal challenges are delaying the regional government\u2019s plan to spread urban development beyond the urban area and onto treasured green fields. There have been 35,000 public responses to the south-west plan from all over the region - almost all thought to be objections. Local councils want to fully consult local people too. So the chances of the whole process being overtaken by the approaching General Election are increasingly good. Martin will continue to defend our countryside."

Martin will be his party\u2019s national spokesman on the bill in the House of Commons which will mean that he has the chance to stand up for flood victims right across the country - from flood prevention and insurance claims to planning regulations and developers\u2019 responsibilities. The main risk that the government have left it almost too late now to bring a bill before a General Election."

Martin flew to Germany (his first and so far only official flight as an MP) to try to save 150 jobs at FormFlo in Rowanfield.

He voted against keeping MPs\u2019 expenses secret and has been leading the independent auditor Sir Thomas Legg that he has no money to repay and no questions to answer about his own expenses. Another independent report - by Sir Christopher Kelly - has not reached the same conclusion but he has to be stopped. Martin has backed wholesale implementation of all of Kelly\u2019s recommendations."
