She is gambling on gaining sufficient lobby fodder to dilute Brexit and give concessions to Brussels. Blackpool South certainly needs Labour out but deserves more than a Tory nodding dog and I therefore urge you to vote for me in this election. I believe in a thriving 52 weeks a year tourism economy, I welcome the jobs on offer in the fracking industry and I believe in REAL Brexit. Yours sincerely, Noel Matthews"
