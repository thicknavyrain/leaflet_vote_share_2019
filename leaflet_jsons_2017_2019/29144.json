For 50 years, I was a proud member of the Labour Party as an MP and campaigner.\nBut now I've joined the Liberal Democrats.\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision to make - I'm leaving behind friends in the Labour Party and it hurts. But it\u2019s the right choice. I can\u2019t stay in a party that has abandoned so many of its core values.\nI was appalled by the abject failure of Labour leaders to take the lead in the Brexit referendum. Labour was uniquely qualified to take on the falsehoods peddled by the Leave campaign on the NHS and much else beside.\nBut to see Labour leaders then sign up to Brexit alongside Conservative and UKIP MPs was the final straw. In doing so they rejected the principles of internationalism held dear by Labour for decades.\nBritain needs a party who will stand up for the values that Labour has left behind.\nThat party is the Liberal Democrats. They have been consistent on Europe, just as they were in their opposition to the war in Iraq and on civil liberties.\nThey are the party that offers young people hope on the key issues of the day. From Europe to globalisation and climate change, the Lib Dems are the voice of sanity and reason.\nPlease do give the Lib Dems your active support.\nBest wishes,\nBob Marshall-Andrews\nPS This election could change Britain for generations - vote for a better future and use your vote to back the Liberal Democrats."
