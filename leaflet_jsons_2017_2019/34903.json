However, I know that there are concerns and I very much welcome the 150 extra police officers deployed in Essex last year with another 215 to come. Recently, I went on patrol with the new Maldon Town Centre Team and I am pleased that there is another new Team in South Woodham Ferrers as well as an expanded Rural Engagement Team covering the villages. Boris Johnson has now committed to an additional 20,000 police officers on our streets nationally and I am pressing to ensure we get our fair share."
