The Tories are taking the country backwards. They have pushed our public services into crisis. Our NHS and social care face a state of emergency, while our local schools face funding cuts of \u00a3545 per pupil. This general election can be the chance for a fresh start with a Labour government. We will introduce a real Living Wage of \u00a310 per hour. We will always give the NHS the money it needs, and we will ensure local schools get the funding they need. Labour will also invest in new affordable homes to rent and buy, building over a million new homes in five years."
