Conservatives have many immediate policies to help cope with Gordon Brown's recession and on page 2, I will outline these policies and the longer term view. Locally, it is important that we start to think about how Wyre Forest can benefit from the Conservative plans to enhance our local economy, critically, attract visitors to our wonderful district. We need to encourage people to holiday at home this year. Whilst Britain\u2019s economy faces a stern test, visitors are going to play a key role. The Wyre Forest can look forward to an exciting 2009, with attractions like the West Midlands Safari Park and the Severn Valley Railway - which opens from flood damage at Easter - all acting as a key draw to our district - visitors who will bring much needed cash into our local economy."
