        "personalStatement": "I was born at the City General Hospital in 1970 and first lived in Burslem. We didn\u2019t have much, but we worked hard and had a good life because of the transformative policies brought in by the post-war Labour Government. As our family grew and my dad became a miner, we moved to a council house in Brindley Ford, complete with an indoor toilet. My mum was a sewing machinist and later a care worker for the elderly. Labour\u2019s revolution in council housing gave my family the chance of a decent home. I had a difficult time at high school; by the time I left Brownhills High School, it was with few qualifications. I had many varied jobs across Stoke and Newcastle in pot banks, warehouses and shops. My first child was born in 1992 and went to school in Audley. She still works as a primary school teacher. Following the 1997 election, Labour\u2019s expansion of adult learning opportunities gave me a second chance at an education, this was cut short when I was suddenly diagnosed with thyroid cancer. If it wasn\u2019t for the amazing care I received from the NHS, I might not have survived. We cannot allow the Conservatives to continue to run the NHS into the ground. During my recovery I started working as a mentor for disadvantaged boys at the same secondary school as my wife Heather, an English teacher from Newcastle. It was also at this time that I began to volunteer. Having a wife and a daughter who are both teachers, I am passionate about giving every best educational opportunities to children. I personally had to go through adult education. I went on to achieve qualifications in counselling, which led me into a rewarding new career in Children\u2019s Services. I worked for several years in family intervention. After becoming team leader and UNISON Steward, I was successfully elected as Assistant Branch Secretary for Manchester UNISON in 2013. Ever since the 2010 election, I have campaigned on behalf of workers and the Labour Party. I have now taken on the challenge of being your Prospective Parliamentary Candidate in Newcastle-under-Lyme. We are really excited at the prospect of moving, with our two young children, back to North Staffordshire where Heather and I grew up, and where our families still live.",
