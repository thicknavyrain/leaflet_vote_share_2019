A Tory majority means a hard Brexit is bad for businesses and bad for our hard working families. Whilst the Tories obsess over a hard Brexit they are not even talking about the issues that matter to people in Wimbledon: the services we need, our public services and that is what our policies will achieve. With your vote for Labour we will seek to build a fairer, many, not the few, and invest in the future of transportation, the NHS, and businesses and for a country that works in the interests of the many. I will use my experience as a local businessman, lawyer, volunteer and father of four, to stand up for everyone."
