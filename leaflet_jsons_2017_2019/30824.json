They got the EU referendum wrong, and as Jeremy Corbyn has said himself, he was a 200-1 outside chance for the Labour leadership. So in days of shock election results and global uncertainty, no one can ever really be sure who will win. And with so much at stake, let\u2019s not risk it."

It\u2019s nonsense for Labour to claim that a vote for them locally in the Gedling constituency doesn\u2019t matter nationally. Because the simple fact is that, Jeremy Corbyn will claim each and every vote for Labour in the Gedling constituency as a vote for him, and as a vote for his nonsensical and dangerous ideas. And if Jeremy Corbyn wins in the Gedling constituency, his position is strengthened and my negotiating position is weakened. So the only way to back me is by voting Conservative in your local constituency of Gedling. A vote to back me is a vote to get the best Brexit deal possible. And your interest, too. A vote to back me is a vote to strengthen my negotiating position, to ensure we get the best Brexit deal possible. And a vote to back me is a vote to guarantee our economic security for the future. So Richard, please give me your backing and your vote. Together we can get on with the job of making life better for all of us."
