                "content": "Dear Neighbour, Like you, I want an MP who will work hard for our area and speak up for us in Parliament. But after the last election here, we were effectively left without an MP. We had no one to speak up for us. No one to vote for us in Parliament. And no one to turn to if we needed any help. With everything that is going on with politics at the moment, I want to guarantee a hardworking local MP. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be backing Laura Gordon. Elections here are usually close between the Lib Dems and Labour \u2013 but I just can\u2019t trust Labour after the mess their MP caused last time. He got himself in trouble and the Labour Party left us in the lurch with effectively no representation. Laura Gordon is someone we can trust. Laura has spent her career working for charities such as Oxfam and Save the Children in some of the most challenging places on earth. Locally, she led the campaign to save the NHS Walk-in Centre and Minor Injuries Unit. She fought against Labour\u2019s tree felling fiasco and she\u2019s been working to secure fair funding for Sheffield\u2019s schools. If we elect Laura as our MP, I know she will speak up for people like me. She will work hard to tackle inequality. She will work hard to fight the climate crisis. And she will campaign passionately for our schools and NHS. I know I can trust Laura to listen, work hard and get things done for local people. When you vote on 12th December, please do consider joining me in supporting Laura Gordon. With best wishes, Mary Aston Fellow Sheffield Hallam resident P.S. After the mess they caused last time, I can\u2019t trust Labour. On 12th December, I\u2019ll be voting for Laura Gordon to guarantee an MP who will work hard and get things done."
