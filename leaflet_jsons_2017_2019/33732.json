With local people, I have campaigned successfully to deliver government investment for local rail, road and flood defence projects and more standard class seats between Reading and Paddington. I supported parent groups to set up the Wren School and All Saints Junior School, delivering extra funding and new school places. And, with patient groups, I worked to maintain the hydrotherapy pool at the Royal Berkshire Hospital and am supporting improvements in our local NHS services."
