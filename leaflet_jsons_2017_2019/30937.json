For nearly 35 years; I've proudly served our NHS.\nIn 2010 I rose to become the Chair of the Royal College of GPs. But I resigned from this position in 2015. It was one of the toughest things I've ever had to do, but I couldn't stay quiet any longer.\n\nOne of our proudest institutions is being damaged by a desperate quest for privatisation by Theresa May's Conservatives.\n\nOur beloved NHS is at breaking point.\nThis winter saw the worst ever crisis for A&E departments. 1.2 million of our elderly people are not getting the care they need. 15% of operations are cancelled.\n\nWe cannot let this vandalism go on any longer. That's why I am campaigning for the Liberal Democrats in this election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are the only party to set out a clear plan to fund the NHS. A penny on income tax for the NHS will ease the pressure on NHS staff and patients until long-term solutions can be found.\n\nThe future of the NHS is in your hands.\nFive more years of Theresa May's Conservatives will give them free reign for more and more NHS cuts. Only a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote of confidence in our NHS."
