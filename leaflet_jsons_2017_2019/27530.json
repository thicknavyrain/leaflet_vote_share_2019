I have worked hard over the last seven years to keep my pledge to be a strong local voice for North Tyneside in Parliament and to do all I can to make life better for everyone who lives here, whether helping to bring 2,000 jobs to the Tyne or helping an individual with their tax query. My values have never changed, I want to see a fairer and more just society. I have always been honest and have an unblemished political record. I have always put my constituents first and my party second and whilst my Party\u2019s leaders have come and gone in the last seven years, the Labour Party remains firmly rooted in its core values. I promise you that, if re-elected I will continue to fight for North Tyneside with determination, passion and conviction."
