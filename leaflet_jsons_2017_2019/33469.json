Johnson\u2019s EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement is 535 pages of UK commitments in return for nothing. This is not freedom, democracy, sovereignty or taking back control that we voted for but a Treaty of Vassalage and continued payments. LibDems and Labour have no intention of honoring the Referendum, openly showing their contempt for democracy. Vote UKIP to send our treacherous liar politicians a message they will never forget.
