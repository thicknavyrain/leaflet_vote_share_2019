Parliament spent the last three years going round in circles - agreeing on nothing except more arguments. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to get Brexit done and get on with the country\u2019s priorities? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to stop arguing about the past and start building the kind of future we want? A future where you don\u2019t have to wait three weeks for a GP appointment - because our NHS has the funding it needs to thrive. And an immigration system that supports our public services instead of putting pressure on them. A future where you feel safe when you walk home at night - because our police have the officers they need to get a grip on crime. A future where your children get a world-class education - because no school is underfunded or left behind. This is the kind of future we can create together. It\u2019s just within our grasp. At the last election, only nine seats stood short of a majority. This election will be just as close, and it all comes down to your vote."
