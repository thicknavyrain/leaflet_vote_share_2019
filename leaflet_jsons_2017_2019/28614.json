Theresa May talks about supporting the ordinary working class, but her actions tell another story - it is the rich that benefit under the Conservatives. Labour now has a leader who will deliver a radical alternative; ending the policies of failed austerity and the dogma of privatisation supported by both the Tories and the LibDems. We will work to rebuild our welfare state and reduce the inequalities that are becoming ever more apparent. Through investment in our economy we can build an efficient, sustainable, environmentally friendly way forward for everyone and a society we are proud of. Jill Payne"
