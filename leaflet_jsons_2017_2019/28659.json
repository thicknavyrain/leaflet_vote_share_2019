He's also proven to be independent-minded. He rebelled over tax credits only a few weeks after being elected and went against the party whip to vote in favour of a fairer voting system. He opposed the bombing of Syria and voted against renewing Trident. Unlike his Lib Dem opponent, it's clear that Daniel will never prop up a Tory Government.",
