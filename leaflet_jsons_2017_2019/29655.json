Labour can't, they're split and weak. The Lib Dems won't as they oppose the will of the people. Now Ken Clarke has sided with their coalition of chaos, turning against his party and his country. It's time for him to go. If you want a truly conservative government and a decent principled opposition, a strong and stable future means it is time to vote UKIP in Rushcliffe.\nYours sincerely, Matthew Faithfull"
