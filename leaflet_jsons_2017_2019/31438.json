A solicitor by profession, Robert is married with two grown up daughters. He is campaigning to replace the unfair Business Rates system which is making life so tough for local shops and pubs. He is a strong advocate of small and public transport, has fought for the Fairfield re-development area in Burgess Hill and also sits on the area\u2019s housing committee. Robert has successfully defended the rights of EU citizens to remain in the UK. 'I believe passionately in a more just society,' says Robert, 'and I will work hard for people to make life better for all and to keep us from crashing out of the EU at all.'"
