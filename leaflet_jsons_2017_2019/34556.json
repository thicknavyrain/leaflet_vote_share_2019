Parliament had the duty to follow instructions it received from the people, but failed to do so. That is why we are having an election now. We need to get Brexit done, a new Parliament that respects the people, and get on with the job of governing the country.\nI know from speaking to the people of Clwyd West that, when we get Brexit finished, this is what will happen. Only the Conservatives will do that.\nI have represented the people of this constituency at Westminster since 2005. I live in the heart of Clwyd West. My continued local access has always been important to me.\nYou vote for me will help ensure that, after Brexit, Clwyd West will continue to have a strong, effective local MP for years to come."
