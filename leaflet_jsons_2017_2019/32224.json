I\u2019m frightened for all the young people unable to access adequate services and I\u2019m frightened that patients are all too often turned away.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m backing the Liberal Democrats in this election. Their plan to put mental health on an equal footing with physical, ensuring treatment is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year will ensure we have the mental health service and care Britain needs.\n\nI\u2019m proud of our NHS and of the colleagues I work with, but we are sick and tired of being passed over and demoralised when it\u2019s our mental health department, which yet again faces cuts.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have recognised this \u2013 and have announced that they will give the NHS the money it needs to treat mental health with the seriousness and priority it deserves.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats offer the brighter future\u00a0my patients so deserve."
