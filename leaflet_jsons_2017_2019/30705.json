This time am determined to defend the principle of taxpayers covering the cost to buy decent healthcare for all according to need rather than ability to pay. We\u2019ve seen many people waiting more than four hours in Accident & Emergency. So I will campaign for the Government to invest in more funding to tackle these areas and make sure that NHS issues across all walks of patients from across the city and region come together and work for a stronger and fairer society.\u2019"
