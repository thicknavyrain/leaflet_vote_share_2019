The Liberal Democrats' plan for government stands in stark contrast to the dreary offer from the Conservatives or Labour. They want to drag us back to the 1970s with their close allies abroad, hiking taxes, weakening our environment or the Labour leadership's failure to root out anti-Semitism. So has sow fear in our communities and allow hatred to spread. Jo Swinson said, 'We have an ambitious plan for the future of our country, where every single person, every community and our planet can thrive. A Liberal Democrat government will create a shared vision for the country we want to be, where every single person and community is valued, empowered, and cared for, and where we protect our planet for future generations.' Jo added, 'We will reinvent the relationship between business and the communities in which they operate, so that they are a part of the solution to our biggest challenges, not the problem. A Liberal Democrat government will stop Brexit and deliver a brighter future for everyone.'"
