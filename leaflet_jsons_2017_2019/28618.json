We were successful in convincing most of our supporters but not the wider public. Since then, Theresa May has invoked Article 50 and has been busy burning bridges with Brussels, seemingly intent on a most chaotic and catastrophic brexit. Other parties have floated the idea of a second referendum. I believe this would achieve nothing more than entrench the divisions that the referendum created, and lose us precious negotiating time with Brussels. The clock is ticking! I believe Labour has the right brexit strategy. We will negotiate the best deal we can, prioritising jobs, the economy, the environment, workers' rights and consumer protections. If elected, I would fight for the right of the British people to look at the final brexit deal and have the final say on whether the deal we have negotiated is what they want for Britain."
