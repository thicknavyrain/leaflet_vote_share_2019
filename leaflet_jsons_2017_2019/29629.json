Our NHS \u2013 once the envy of the world \u2013 is in crisis. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can change the direction of our country \u2013 and save our NHS. We will invest an extra \u00a36bn a year in our NHS and social care system; paid for through an immediate 1p rise in all rates of income tax. This funding will be ring-fenced to be spent only on the NHS and social care and will provide vital services with the money they desperately need. But we also know that providing more money is not enough \u2013 that\u2019s why our extra funding is part of a five-point recovery plan to put health and care services on a more sustainable footing long term."
