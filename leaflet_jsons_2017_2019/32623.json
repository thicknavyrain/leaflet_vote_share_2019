                "content": "Dear Voter,\nMy name's Steve Masters, and I am seeking your support in the General Election on Thursday 12 December. First, a bit about me. After serving in the Royal Air Force for nearly 20 years, I have been a care worker and campaigner in West Berkshire. I was elected to West Berkshire Council and Newbury Town Council as a Green Party councillor this year. So what are the main issues facing us in this crucial election?\n\nClimate change\nA crisis that affects us all. I have been at the forefront of local campaigning on this issue and involved in national protests with Extinction Rebellion. I started the successful petition to make West Berkshire Council declare a climate emergency. To reach our carbon neutral target by 2030 will involve everyone -- but we will all benefit from cleaner air, increased health and wellbeing and a reduction in dangerous weather extremes.\n\nHousing\nMy personal experience of homelessness has left me acutely aware of the lack of affordable and quality homes in the UK. I have been a tireless campaigner on housing ever since. I was heavily involved in writing the award winning report on homelessness for Healthwatch West Berkshire and in setting up the community-led hostel last winter. I am chair of trustees at Eight Bells for Mental Health Newbury.\n\nEurope\nThe EU has played a vital role in maintaining peace and prosperity across Europe since we joined in 1973. Lives have been transformed -- from the opportunity to travel freely to study and work anywhere in Europe, to cleaner beaches, and guaranteed parental and holiday leave.\n\nThe EU is not perfect -- but our future relationship with Europe will only be successful if we can influence its direction from within. Newbury voted Remain but our Conservative MP ignored the wishes of the majority of his constituents. That's why it is vital we restore voters and engage with communities who have been left behind. The Green Party believes the only way to heal the country's deep divisions is to give everyone a vote on the Government's final deal. We will abide by the decision of that vote.\n\nYours sincerely,"
