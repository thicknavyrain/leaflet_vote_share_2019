That\u2019s why I am campaigning for the Liberal Democrats in this election.\nThe Liberal Democrats are the only party to set out a clear plan to fund the NHS. A penny on income tax for the NHS will ease the pressure on NHS staff and patients until long-term solutions can be found.\nThe future of the NHS is in your hands.\nFive more years of Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives will give them free reign for more and more NHS cuts. Only a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote of confidence in our NHS.\nPS \u2013 As an NHS doctor, I am fearful of the damage that would be done to the NHS by an all-powerful Conservative government.
