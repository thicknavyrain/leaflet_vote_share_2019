The automotive industry is one of the great British industries. Its success has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of workers in the West Midlands with good, well-paid jobs. However, the problems facing the industry are mounting by the day because of the Tory Government\u2019s mishandling of the economy and the threat of a No Deal Brexit. It\u2019s estimated a No Deal Brexit could cut UK car production by half a million that would mean tens of thousands of British workers like us paying the price. Labour has always been on the side of workers and our industries. When our plants faced closure or workers faced redundancy, we knew Labour had our backs. Now they\u2019ll fight for a good deal for Britain that will protect jobs of workers like us as we leave the European Union. For years the Tory Government have held back not just our industries, but our towns, cities and communities. Pay has stagnated and living standards are falling. Most of those in poverty nowadays are actually in work but struggling to make ends meet. You can\u2019t trust the Tories for workers. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll be voting Labour on 12 December."
