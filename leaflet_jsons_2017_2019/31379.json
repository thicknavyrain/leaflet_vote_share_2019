Waiting times have soared for GP appointments, in A&E departments and for mental health services. Young people in need of mental health support can find themselves waiting over a year for help. Lib Dem Leader Jo Swinson is leading the fight to secure the funds the NHS needs. She said, 'We\u2019ve heard Conservatives promise the world on the NHS again and again. The reality is always very different. Fewer resources leading to more cuts and more patients suffering. A Liberal Democrat government will raise much needed extra funds for our NHS starting with a penny in Income Tax to tackle the crisis.' Trump's NHS Threat: When Donald Trump visited Britain recently, he made it clear that the NHS would be part of negotiating any trade deals with the US. Trump and Johnson have tried to row back from his comments, but many are not convinced. Jo Swinson added, 'We will fight any attempts to privatise the NHS. The US health system is not a model any country should wish to replicate.'"
