But, partly due to the work of UKIP in the past, our country was finally given a referendum.\nIn that campaign, I worked hard for the Vote Leave team. In that referendum, many Conservative and UKIP supporters came together, along with supporters from other parties, to achieve the result our country needed.\nNow, it is time for UKIP supporters to make their votes count again. Here in the Wallasey Constituency, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s candidate stands for neither Brexit nor Labour is, at best, weak, and has now delayed Brexit.\nA vote for UKIP this time will only help Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s candidate to win again. I am writing to ask you to go with your vote instead.\nI\u2019m not a career politician. I\u2019m a dad of four who has lived in the real world, I worked as a builder and I am a big believer that Parliament needs more people who live in the real world.\nIf elected as your new MP on Thursday 8th June, I will work with Theresa May to make a success of Brexit so that Britain will, once again, have control over immigration.\nAt the same time, we will be free to pursue trade with European markets, and secure new trade agreements with other countries.\nI am also committed to improving our NHS, schools and public services. It\u2019s only by having a strong and stable economy that we will generate the money needed to pay for this investment.\nAt this election, it\u2019s a choice between me, Theresa May\u2019s candidate in Wallasey, or Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s candidate. UKIP is too far behind and can\u2019t win here.\nYours sincerely\nAndy Livsey\nAndy Livsey\nTheresa May\u2019s Conservative Candidate\nP.S. If you need any information about where and when to vote, call the Elections Unit at the Town Hall on 691 8046."
