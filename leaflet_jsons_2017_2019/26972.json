I will always put local people first. On Thursday 8 June we have an important choice. We can't go back to the broken promises of the past. We need a Labour MP who will vote against Brexit, not a Lib Dem who will do a deal with the Tories. So I promise to stand by our community and oppose the Tories and Brexit - and I keep my promises."
