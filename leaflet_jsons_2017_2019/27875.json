With your support, my plan for South Gloucestershire will build a stronger, fairer society. Having called on Theresa May to call this election, I was pleased when she announced it. Why? Because, in South Gloucestershire, and especially Thornbury and Yate, we have the starkest of choices at this election... We have managed to secure the commitment we campaigned for, a \u00a34bn investment in schools, the biggest since records began. With more children in good or outstanding schools, the investment will give teachers the resources they need... We've seen waiting times fall at NHS A&E, unemployment rates fall to our lowest on record, businesses are creating jobs, and our economy is growing. The Brexit deal secured by Theresa May will deliver our exit from the EU, a control on our borders, and create the budget needed to fund our public services. So this election is vitally important - we'll continue to all work together to deliver better services and a strong economy. Luke"
