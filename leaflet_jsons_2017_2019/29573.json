Government Inspectors have over-ruled the Sandbach Neighbourhood Plan. A recent Supreme Court judgment allowing 150 houses in the Green Gap near Willaston exposed that government policy is a 'tilted balance' in favour of developers and suggests that even the long-awaited Cheshire East Local Plan may not be the end of the nightmare. If I'm elected I will send a strong message that no more speculative housing applications should be approved. If elected as MP for Congleton I will protect our communities from over-development and save our beautiful countryside."
