His message to you is clear: I am standing as The Green Party candidate because I believe we all deserve better than we are getting. We deserve a democracy built on honesty and integrity, we deserve an economic system which is fair and balanced and we deserve an environment we can be healthy in and proud to pass on to future generations. Change happens when people believe it is possible. I believe it is possible to create a country we can all be a part of, which leads the world in the way it lives with itself and others, and which responds positively to the challenges of the 21st Century. If you agree with me that we can do better, that our politicians should offer us hope and not fear, and that you want to live in a society which is compassionate and generous, then I believe that now, more than ever, is the time to send that message very clearly to Westminster. Now is the time to vote Green."
