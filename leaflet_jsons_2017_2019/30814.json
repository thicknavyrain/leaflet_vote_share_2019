It's clear we cannot trust a word she says.\n\nServing you as your Member of Parliament for the last 20 years has been a privilege and honour. I'm standing again because although we've achieved a lot together, there is still much, much more to do.\n\nPutting you and our community first has always been my top priority. That's why I have opposed Tory cuts to all our local schools, our local hospitals and public services. It's also why I'm committed to ensuring we get the best possible deal for Gedling constituency from the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThis election, in Gedling, will be a choice between me or a Tory who will simply do as Theresa May tells them. Of course, other parties will stand but in the end the real choice here in Gedling is clear\u2014me or a Tory.\n\nThe truth is this election is a choice about the values we have and the future we want as a country. I will always fight for the people of Gedling, even in the face of a Tory Prime Minister who breaks promises and seems intent on giving more to the rich while letting down local working people, families and those who need a helping hand.\n\nThat's why I am asking for your continued support."
