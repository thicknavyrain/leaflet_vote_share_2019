I aim to deliver real results for our neighbourhood, as the back page shows. Before being elected, I set up and ran my own businesses. I have been in business since I was 24, starting off selling leather goods, growing and growing it to employing hundreds of people. This kind of real-world experience means I know how to get things done. The NHS is a subject very close to my heart. In 2013, my twins were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. The NHS saved their lives, as it has saved the lives of many local residents. Please vote for me again, and I still remember my first all-night Journey from the hospital in 1991. Although it is a tough job, there is no place I would prefer to do it than right here in our shared borough. I was born and brought up in a Grammar school area, so a key priority is to ensure that our educational system can provide the very best education for all our children is vital. I hope to have your support on December 12th so that I can continue to be an active and energetic local MP for our area and deliver results for our community.
