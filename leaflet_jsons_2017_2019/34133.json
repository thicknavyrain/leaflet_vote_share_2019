Tariq has a long association with Ealing Southall and together with Siobhan Benita, our candidate for London Mayor next year, he will fight for the area which has been shockingly neglected by successive Conservative and Labour governments and councils. He is totally opposed to Brexit which will damage the futures of everyone for generations to come. As you'd expect, he will fight for Ealing Hospital. In addition to his knowledge of, and passion for, the National Health Service he is particularly concerned about the housing crisis, knife crime and the shocking air quality problem. The Lib Dems are the biggest and most effective anti-Brexit party in the country. Over 30,000 new members have joined since the election. Why not join us? Use the link below."
