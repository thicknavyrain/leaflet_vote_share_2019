Improve rail and local bus services: We are campaigning for better access at Wallasey Village Station, an extra station for Moreton and re-regulating some bus routes.\n\n3. Protecting support for pensioners: We will continue to provide Winter Fuel Payments, free prescriptions and pension rises for older people. We will campaign for the BBC to maintain free TV licenses.\n\n4. Supporting our NHS to give the care they need: We have been running the NHS for 44 of the 71 years it has existed. We will give the NHS the biggest cash boost in its history.\n\n5. Every child should have the chance to succeed in life: We will guarantee at least \u00a34,000 to every primary school pupil and \u00a35,000 on every high school student.\n\n6. Challenge the Birkenhead-based Wirral Council: James Baker will stand up for Wallasey and Moreton, fighting for a fairer share of council services for the community."
