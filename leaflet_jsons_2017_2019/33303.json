Like you, I am frustrated with national politics and the MP\u2019s endless chase for fame rather than effective representation for Broxtowe. I believe serving as an MP is a service and a duty to the people. To promote our home, both locally and nationally, as we have so much to be proud of.\n\nI joined the Royal Air Force as a young man because I wanted to serve my country - and thanks to my job, I got to see the world. Then I settled in Broxtowe where my wife Caroline and I are delighted to call home. As someone who has served alongside the finest in our Armed Forces, I chose Broxtowe - it is a unique constituency where our traditions marry with innovation and diversity.\n\nThe current MP for Broxtowe has voted against implementing Brexit over 346 times - we need an MP who will represent the voice of the local residents and deliver Brexit and a fair and balanced immigration policy. I pledge to do just that and more.\n\nMy background as the son of a Jamaican soldier who was killed in Giffnock when we first met in 1974 and my mother was posted to Redford Barracks, Edinburgh means that I have lived in two worlds: a world of discipline and a world of opportunity. I grew up understanding the value of hard work and that's what I believe in most of all. Hard work and success where people prosper.\n\nCaroline and I married after meeting in Birmingham. We know first hand if you work hard, there are opportunities for everyone. We want to protect our high standards of living and our local services such as our NHS. We must improve them so our children get the best start in life.\n\nMy track record as an RAF Officer, as a Conservative activist and as a local Councillor, demonstrates my commitment to British values. We are facing uncertain times with waking competition to our British institutions and our democratic rights. I am ready to champion our values.\n\nVote for change. Vote for someone you can trust. Vote for me, Darren Henry, on 12th December. MY HEART! Where it should be. Broxtowe is where I want to serve as your loyal Member of Parliament."
