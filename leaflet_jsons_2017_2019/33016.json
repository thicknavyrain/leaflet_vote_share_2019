We need to grow our local NHS services and I will do my utmost to protect and campaign for Queen\u2019s and King George hospitals and I will make sure we get our fair share of government spending on the NHS. Let\u2019s grow Dagenham & Rainham into a place of excellence - we need to attract investment in jobs and greater housing opportunities for our younger people. I will continue to campaign for more police on our streets and for a fairer deal for Dagenham and Rainham."
