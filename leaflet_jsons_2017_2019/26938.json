I have two decades of experience standing up for people in North East Fife. I worked with the fishing and farming communities. I have strong ties with the university. My commitment will always be to speak up for our area first and foremost. I am standing against the SNP\u2019s campaign for another referendum. The SNP\u2019s obsession with independence tires everything their MPs do. It\u2019s not what people in this area want."
