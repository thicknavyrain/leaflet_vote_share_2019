For too long, craven politicians in Westminster have betrayed us, reneging on their 2017 manifesto promises. Johnson\u2019s treaty ignores the 17.4 million people who voted to LEAVE; no ifs, no buts, no \u00a339 billion payment, and no extended \u2018transition\u2019 period where we must continue to obey Brussels\u2019 diktats. Labour wants a second referendum. While the Libdems would revoke Article 50 to lock us into the EU forever. You, the people of Holborn & St Pancras, deserve better! In this election, a vote for UKIP is a vote to honour the referendum result where we take back full control of our laws, borders, finances and trade. No more fudge judges or delays! Vote UKIP on December 12th, 2019 and send the Establishment a message they will never forget. Mohammad Ali Bhatti"
