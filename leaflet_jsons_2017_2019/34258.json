I went to Parmiter's School and won a place to study law at Cambridge University. I live locally with my wife and two children. My experiences have taught me the value of hard work. I believe in providing for yourself, your family and serving your community and country. We are fortunate to have the best of both worlds here in Hertsmere - beautiful countryside, distinct towns and villages, a strong sense of community, but relatively easy access to London. As Hertsmere's MP for the past four years, I have sought to preserve and enhance this. I have used my skills and experiences to give you a strong voice nationally and stand up for your interests. It would be an honour to be re-elected and have the opportunity to serve you again as your MP."
