There is no evidence that the government's obsession with free schools, academies and grammar schools has improved standards. Money wasted on these vanity schemes will go into the education system and make the biggest difference. There is growing evidence, for example, that Sure Start Children's Centres made a massive difference to the children who went to them. This and more will be at the centre of our educational policies.",

Every secondary school under the new school funding scheme, with Marling and Thomas Keble losing the maximum possible and Katherine Lady Berkeley just under behind. With school buildings especially needing a significant investment, now is the worst time to be cutting educational spending. It is a crisis, and it is only going to get worse under the Tories. From children's centres, through academy chains to universities, our education system is steadily being privatised and downgraded. Labour will take the profit motive out of education and do the right thing for our children.",
