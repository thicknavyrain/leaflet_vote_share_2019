It will ensure a 'just transition' to a better society in which nobody gets left behind, benefiting people every bit as much as the environment. The Green New Deal was first proposed by a team that included Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. It is such a powerful idea that it has since been seized upon by other political parties across the world. Labour have renamed it the Green Industrial Revolution, but the Green New Deal is about more than just decarbonising \u2013 it is about rethinking how we live our lives and making positive changes across society."
