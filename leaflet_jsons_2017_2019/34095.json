It does not give Britain back our democratic right to be a free and independent nation. It forces us to accept new laws and spending demands by a foreign government with no interest in the lives of the British people.\nSay no to this deal. Vote for Roy Freshwater and UKIP\u2019s manifesto on the 12th of December to send a message that you want to leave the European Union with a genuine Clean-Break Brexit."
