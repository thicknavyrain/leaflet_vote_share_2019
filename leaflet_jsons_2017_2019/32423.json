                "content": "Having represented Chesham and Amersham for over 27 years my priority has always been to serve my constituents and work to allow our towns and villages to flourish whilst giving protection to the Green Belt. Brexit has led to delays on many new bills reaching Parliament. In the next Parliament we must pass laws that protect the public from human traffickers, adopt the Pensions Act for constitution, take forward our new environmental protection measures, deliver new animal welfare measures and bring in further protections for tenants; measures all designed to deliver a Brexit which brings certainty and clarity for business and a deal agreed with the EU that will free the nation from indecision and the possibility of a \u2018no exit\u2019 from Brexit. Whether in our schools, our hospitals, in adult social care, our banking system or local businesses, we must go forward to ensure that professional, dependable services are evenly available to everyone. The Brexit debate has overshadowed the normal business of Parliament. Other parties have also had their role in frustrating new legislation designed to protect constituents. I will vote for Conservatives\u2019 withdrawal agreement that will end the current uncertainty. The local priorities for me and for us remain clear. We keep our responsibilities to senior citizens, housing, business and local employment and at the same time balance the investment in Chesham\u2019s and Amersham\u2019s environment, in education and in local facilities. This is our stated aim. I will continue with the same level of energy and commitment if you re-elect me, to new transport infrastructure projects, vital services, improvements in our public areas and we will carry the mark for our ambitions. I know how important it is to safeguard our NHS, protect our senior citizens and other vulnerable groups while at the same time creating jobs for those entering the workplace for the first time or looking to return to employment. Please support me again on 12 December so I can be of continuing service to you in all my actions."
