In the last three years, other political parties have said one thing on Brexit and then done another. Will this time be different? As well as ensuring Brexit, we must also reform our politics:\n \u2022 Repeal all laws that restrict freedom of speech\n \u2022 Promote a fairer electoral system\nSovereignty belongs to the people. Parliament should have no power to reduce it or steal it from us. Constitutional changes that have an effect must be for the electorate to decide. It\u2019s time to bring power back to the people."
