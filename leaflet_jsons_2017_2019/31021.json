Only the Green Party has the vision to deliver an alternative future for our country, and our place in the world. And only the Green Party offers a different kind of politics. To shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment. To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services. And to put power back in your hands through a citizens\u2019 democracy. If you agree with us, stand with us. The Conservatives think they have this election sewn up. But it\u2019s in your hands. Stand with us for housing, schools, our NHS, our environment, and our future. We stand up for what matters. Vote Green Party on 8th June."
