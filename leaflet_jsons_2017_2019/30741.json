With no effective opposition, there will be nothing to stop a rampant Tory government: Starving the NHS of the money it needs, slashing funding for schools and colleges, scrapping the triple lock on pensions, imposing a dementia tax and removing the winter fuel allowance for 10 million of our elderly citizens. I am seeking your support again at this election because Bury South needs a strong Labour voice in Westminster to oppose the Tories every step of the way. Please give me the chance to continue that fight for you."
