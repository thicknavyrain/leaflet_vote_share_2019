Whether you voted to leave or remain in the EU referendum more than three years ago, it is clear that politicians in Westminster are concerned more with their own personal agenda rather than delivering on a democratic vote. For 27 years, UKIP has been at the front of the battle for a Clean-Break Brexit, a Brexit that ensures the United Kingdom can operate as a successful nation. Vote UKIP to send a message loud and clear to the political class. United, we can make a difference."
