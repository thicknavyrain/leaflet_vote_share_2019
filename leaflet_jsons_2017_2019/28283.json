Growing privatisation and deepening austerity measures have ravaged our public services and targeted the most vulnerable in our society. UKIP have shown the power that a vote for a fringe party can have. Despite not retaining any seats in Parliament, every vote for UKIP has led to the Conservative Party adopting most of their policies. Even the Labour Party has committed to end Freedom of Movement. You don\u2019t need to win a seat for your voice to be heard. So what do you want to say? I am committed to fighting the closure of Southend A&E, protecting the environment, closing tax loopholes, and combatting the spread of hate crime."

To shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment. To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services. To put power back in your hands through a citizen\u2019s democracy. Every Green vote on 8 June will help make that vision a reality. If you agree with us, stand with us. The Conservatives think they have this election sewn up. But it's in your hands. Stand with us for housing, schools, our NHS, our environment, and our future. We stand up for what matters."
