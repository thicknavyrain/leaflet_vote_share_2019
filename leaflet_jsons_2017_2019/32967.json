We have been joined by MPs from Labour and the Conservatives fed up with the broken politics the two old parties represent. The Liberal Democrats have continued to grow following their stunning European Election result in May when the party beat both Labour and the Conservatives. Our Country deserves better than a choice between two divisive leaders like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. The Liberal Democrats are fighting for proper funding for our NHS and schools. We want to mend our broken politics and build a brighter future for our country."
