        "content": "The Tories are currently governing alone but let’s not forget they had help with so many of their damaging policies from their cosy coalition partners, the Lib Dems. The cruel Bedroom Tax, the top-down re-organisation of the NHS, the punitive £9000 a year university tuition fees and the abolition of the Educational Maintenance Allowance, all of these awful policies had the collaboration of Lib Dems, who voted for Tory slash and burn policies at every turn.\nHere in Leyton & Wanstead in the 2015 General Election, the Lib-Dems came 5th, behind UKIP.\nThe Lib-Dems are opportunists who have proved they do not hold a single belief that they’re not prepared to abandon for the sake of power."

Many A&E departments are seeing patients within four hours.\nJohn Cryer: “I have defended the hospital and successfully campaigned to keep the Leyton Green Clinic open, and to retain the eye test service at Wanstead hospital and extend the hours to weekends. Time and time again I have raised and challenged the failure of the unaccountable Clinical Commissioning Group.”\n“I will always fight for our NHS.”"

        "content": "John Cryer has called for a new and broader remit for football club owners in the wake of the devastating decline of Leyton Orient football club.\nThe club has bowed out of the football league for the first time in over a century and a feel this is not the last league or club to find itself in a battle for its existence due to the interests of a disinterested owner.\nWorking together with the Leyton Orient fans trust, John Cryer has highlighted the club's plight and tabled Early Day Motion in Parliament, calling for a genuine fit and proper persons test for potential club owners.\nJohn Cryer said: “To see such an historic and venerable club such as Orient is tragic. Orient has served this community for many decades, bringing hope, aspiration and community cohesion which has transformed lives in some of our most deprived areas over many years. Orient is far from the last club to face a threat of extinction due to the laws governing club ownership. Once a great institution is gone, it's gone forever and unless the FA wakes up, it won't be the last.”"

        "title": "Tories devastate our local schools' budgets",
        "content": "Undated costed Tory Minister Nick Gibb suggested schools were over-funded. The real figures show the truth: Wanstead High £401,933 less funding Government cuts amounts lost as of September 2019. Leytonstone School £188,287 less Government cuts funds lost as Spetember 2019. The government is asking every local schools to do more with less cash. Labour's John Cryer: “As the father of teenagers, I know how vital the local schools funding crisis has become and surely at the most basic level, we all want our youngest to become fully engaged and our school communities vibrant places to learn. Less money undermines that aim – what use is a Conservative MP locally that is unable to push this fight effectively at the highest level?” John Cryer said."

Instead they are making things worse by forcing Housing Associations to sell their stock, further diminishing the stock of affordable properties.\nIn Waltham Forest, 7500 households are on the council waiting list, with over 1000 families from the area living in some temporary accommodation, but services are so far away as Luton and Maidstone.\nLabour’s John Cryer said: “Housing issues are a huge part of my casework with many families facing difficult situations. I will continue to work with both our Labour authorities to push for more social and affordable housing. I am proud that Labour has acted on improving the conditions in homes across the area by funding the decent homes strategy. We will continue to make that investment and build to get affordable homes built but we are unable to battle the amount put behind by Tory led Government on new developments.”"
