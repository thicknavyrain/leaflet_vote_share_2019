By voting for a Conservative majority Government, we can end the paralysis in Parliament, get Brexit done and move on to other priorities - our NHS, schools, police and economy. I grew up in West Sussex and live in the constituency with my two daughters, aged 9 and 14, who go to school locally. I am the founder of the Mid Sussex Marathon and, as a former Mid Sussex District Councillor, I know the community and its needs well. I will be a strong local voice for you in Parliament. I am able to combine my local knowledge with experience of getting things done in Westminster as a Government Minister, and will use that experience to deliver for Mid Sussex."
