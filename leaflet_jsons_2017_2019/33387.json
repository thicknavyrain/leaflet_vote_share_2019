I look forward to being one of East Surrey\u2019s strong and local voice in Parliament and bring real change to East Surrey constituency. This election is all about Brexit - and I shall be fighting against the hard Brexit plans planned by both the leaderships of the Conservatives and Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats want the best for farming industries around Horley.\u201d Local Party Chairman, Chris Botten, said: \u201cAlex is an excellent candidate and will be the hard-working communicator. He has the breadth of experience that will enable him to serve the residents of East Surrey to the full.\u201d With the Lib Dems beating the Conservatives, Labour and the Greens in the most recent election, General Election is likely to be a real shoot-out contest between Lib Dem Alex Ehmann and the Conservatives.
