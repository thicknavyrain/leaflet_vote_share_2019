He was twice decorated for service in Afghanistan, where he was responsible for fixing and dispatching Harriers, often under rocket-fire from the Taliban.\nAfter leaving the military, Tim and his wife Jess decided to settle into civilian life and concentrate on their growing family. They initially lived near Stapleford where two of their children Mark, Ella and Ben, and their dog Tahra.\nA keen advocate of British engineering and manufacturing, Tim worked at Bombardier in Derby as a senior engineer and now runs his own business. He has voluntarily supported local secondary schools in promoting STEM subjects and offers presentations, teaching and mentoring the next generation of engineers.\nCommenting on the general area, Tim said, \u201cI love Broxtowe \u2013 the people here are brilliant and it\u2019s an honour to represent them. Ask any politicians cutting funding for services and expecting local communities to pick up the pieces, they will tell you that the services won\u2019t be paid off for generations.\nTim added, \u201cIt\u2019s time we had an MP who won\u2019t take us for granted, one who will put our local issues at the heart of wider careers prospects, and we\u2019ll get some real investment for our area.\u201d"
