Let's bust some myths! \n - Flick will try to attempt to repeal the hunting ban. Repeal is not Conservative Party policy and will not be. \n - The UK is one of the leading nations when it comes to refugees from the Syrian crisis in terms of the numbers we take and the support we provide. - UK jobs aren't going overseas. Unemployment is down; growth in our economy is up. \n - Conservative policies have been good for Portsmouth \u2013 unemployment is down, growth in our economy is up, more homes are being built, more jobs are to come. \n - HMS Queen Elizabeth arrives later this summer. We are buying 138 of the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter jets for the Fleet Air Arm and RAF. Work starts on our new Type 26 frigates in July. \n - Our plans for social care will be fairer than the current model, which cannot continue. Our proposed policy will allow you to pass on more of your home to your family than at present. We will be consulting widely including with Parliament and the media."
