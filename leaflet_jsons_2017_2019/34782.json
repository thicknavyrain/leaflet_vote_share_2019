I use renewable electricity. But we must all do more: as individuals and in our businesses and communities. As a country we must radically reform energy, transport and agriculture to move rapidly to carbon neutrality. And we must reform the regulation of the City. Currently it funds 15% of the world's carbon - we must ensure pensions and investments fund solutions instead. To succeed, we need to cooperate - globally and in the EU."

The Liberal Democrats will always campaign to Remain at the heart of the European Union - as we have since the Referendum. The Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit by winning a People's Vote to remove the barriers stopping Brexit. Jo Swinson's deal will trash our environment and our rights. It will make us poorer and divide our country. And Corbyn's Labour has nothing to offer but dither and delay. Holborn and St Pancras needs a Remain MP in a Remain party. Holborn and St Pancras you have a choice. It is great or it is horrible. Vote for me to Stop Brexit, tackle the climate emergency and invest in our vital public services."
