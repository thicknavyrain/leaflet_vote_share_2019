The Tories lecture the SNP about \u2018getting on with the day job\u2019. Yet thanks to their Brexit obsession, in the last three years it\u2019s been the UK Tory Government that\u2019s ground completely to a halt. In that time, the Tories have plunged thousands more into poverty and hardship. They\u2019ve failed to stand up for key North East industries. They\u2019ve failed to deliver on their responsibilities for broadband and better mobile coverage. They\u2019ve also failed to keep their promises to Scotland made during the 2014 independence referendum. In my time as Aberdeenshire Council leader, I won a reputation for being hard working, pragmatic and for standing up fearlessly for the North East. We need an MP like that right now, who puts the needs of Gordon ahead of the political self-interest of Boris Johnson. At this election, Scotland's voice must be heard and our choices must be respected. With people\u2019s support, as Gordon\u2019s MP I will make sure that is exactly what happens. Sincerely, Richard Thomson"
