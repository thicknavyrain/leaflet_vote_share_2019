On 9 June, we will wake up to one of two people as Prime Minister - Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn. Theresa May will provide the country with strong and stable leadership as we negotiate the terms of our exit from the EU, but Jeremy Corbyn will be presiding over a coalition between Labour, the Greens, Liberals and the SNP - we won't even be able to agree the priorities amongst themselves, and the country will be in chaos as this coalition progresses. A vote for me on 8 June is a vote for stability, and strong government with Theresa May. I hope that I can count on your support."
