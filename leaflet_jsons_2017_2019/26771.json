Protect living standards for all and create jobs. Introduce a real living wage of \u00a310 per hour and invest in infrastructure, skills and new technology. Labour is committed to keeping the Triple Lock for pensioners. 3. Provide affordable homes to rent and buy. Build more than a million new homes in five years and tackle the worst examples of private sector housing exploitation. 4. Give power back to local communities. Give local people a stronger say in the way their high streets and town centres develop. 5. Give all children a chance to achieve. Provide universal free school meals for primary school children and reduce class sizes."
