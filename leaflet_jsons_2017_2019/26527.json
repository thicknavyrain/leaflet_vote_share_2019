                "content": "Dear Friend, The referendum result was bad enough. But with this Government taking the result as an instruction to push the most damaging hard Brexit, it feels even worse. This isn't what I want for my children or my country. Isolation isn't good for Britain. Being outside the single market isn't good for Britain. Ignoring the damage that hard Brexit does to jobs, food prices and industry isn't good for Britain. This election is our chance to get the strong opposition Britain needs. That's why I'm asking you to support the Liberal Democrats this time. The fight to stop a hard Brexit isn't over. The people, not Theresa May, can and should have the final say on the Brexit deal in a referendum. That's what we'll be fighting for with your support. A vote for the Lib Dems is also a vote to stop more harsh cuts to our NHS and our schools. It's a vote against heartless cuts to benefits for bereaved families. This hardline Conservative Government is taking Britain in the wrong direction. On Brexit and on our public services, they are damaging our future. Meanwhile the Labour Party, who should know better, has voted with UKIP and Conservative MPs to back the hard Brexit plans. Please join with me and help change Britain's future in this election. Thanks and best wishes, Tim Farron Leader of the Liberal Democrats"
