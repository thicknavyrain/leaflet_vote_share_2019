You know I am not just another politician who turns up at election time making promises, only to disappear again after polling day. I have lived in Redcar for years and been an active, campaigning MP locally and in Westminster. My record fighting to defend industry, bring jobs, oppose Tory cuts to our schools and hospitals, protect the NHS, and support our steel industries\u2019 stem shows I will always focus on the issues that matter. It is clear the Conservatives are aiming for a thumping majority in this election. Opinion polls suggest that this election is about who can provide the best protection for Redcar in Westminster and who stands up for you in Parliament."
