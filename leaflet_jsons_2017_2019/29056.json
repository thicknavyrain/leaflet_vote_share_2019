He went to his local comprehensive school but because the area needed teachers and Labour set up the ILEA he went to teacher training college for free and had a whole decade in education. At the same time he has the experiences of what it\u2019s like to deal with producers. Chris says \u201cI\u2019m disillusioned because breaking problems into half and sending them out won\u2019t work \u2013 we can\u2019t transform services with privatisation and fragmentation.\u201d",
