WASTING YOUR MONEY ON FOREIGN AID: She is fully committed to giving \u00a314 billion a year of your money on so-called foreign 'aid'. EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS: The Tories have U-turned on their pledge to scrap the hated ECHR. It currently stops us deporting criminals and terrorists and even makes us pay them compensation. BRITAIN'S FISHING WATERS: She won't commit to protecting our fishermen from future Brussels controls. NHS AND SOCIAL CARE CRISIS: Since 2010, May's Tories should have paid \u00a350 billion of EU membership fees. This money should have employed tens of thousands of nurses and carers in our NHS. OUR NATIONAL SECURITY UNDERMINED: Since 2010, police have been cut by 20,000 officers and armed forces by 30,000. While Labour self-destructs and the Lib Dems sell us out to the EU, only UKIP will fight to get the best deal for our nation's future. Please, don't be fooled again by Theresa's promises."
