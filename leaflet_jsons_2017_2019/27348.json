Every Green vote on 8th June will help make that vision a reality. We want to shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment. To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services. And to put power back in your hands through a citizen's democracy. If you agree with us, stand with us. The Conservatives think they have this election sewn up. But it's in your hands. Stand with us for housing, schools, our NHS, our environment, and our future. We stand up for what matters."
