You can choose MPs who will do whatever Theresa May wants - or SNP MPs who will stand up for Scotland. In the years ahead it will be vital to have strong voices for Scotland at Westminster. MPs who will keep a Tory government in check - a Tory government that we know, from long experience, will not have Scotland's best interests at heart. A vote for the SNP will back our plan to end the Tory cuts that are holding our economy back, damaging our public services and pushing more people into poverty, and strengthen Scotland's hand against an extreme Brexit. Now more than ever it is vital to have strong SNP voices standing up for Scotland."
