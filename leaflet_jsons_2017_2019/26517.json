Like so many local people here in Sheffield, I was deeply disappointed to see Labour MPs follow UKIP and the Conservatives through the voting lobby, giving Theresa May a blank cheque for the hardest Brexit possible. That's not what people in Sheffield Hallam voted for. Labour are too weak and too divided to hold the Conservatives to account. They are too busy fighting amongst themselves to fight for the future of our country and they have failed time and time again on the biggest issues. The only party who can provide the effective opposition to the hard Brexit are the Lib Dems. I need your support to make this happen."
