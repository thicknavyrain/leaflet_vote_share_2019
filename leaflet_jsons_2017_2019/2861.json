The food and drink sector generates over \u00a33.5bn of exports per year. Around 122,000 people are directly employed in food production, a large proportion of them in agriculture. Richard said: \u201cScotland has long attached great importance to agriculture. My vision is to have more farm and land-based industries which produce for the market, recognised for the economic, social and environmental benefits derived from them, and which are appropriately regulated.\u201d Tam Smith has praised the approach of the Scottish Government in highlighting the importance of food security and the rural economy, but added: \u201cWe need these powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament to work for Scottish farmers, as too many DEFRA decisions have an adverse impact in Scotland.\u201d"
