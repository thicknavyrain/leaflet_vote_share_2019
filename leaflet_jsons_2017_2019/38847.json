                "content": "Dear Resident,\n\nAround a quarter of people will suffer from a mental health issue this year. That\u2019s over 20,000 people just in Sheffield Hallam.\n\nAnd yet, there is still a chronic imbalance at the heart of the NHS: the way in which we treat people with physical illnesses and those who need mental health support.\n\nThat\u2019s why I'm incredibly proud that the Liberal Democrats have committed to ensuring mental health support is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nI know the difference this will make to the lives of so many here in Sheffield.\n\nEveryone knows the Conservatives can\u2019t be trusted with our NHS. But, if you elect me, I will always speak up for our NHS \u2013 just like I did when I led the campaign to save the NHS Walk-in Centre and Minor Injuries Unit which so many people rely on.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 carefully costed plan will invest in the NHS across Britain. It will start to tackle the problems we hear about every week. We will cut waiting times in our NHS, increase access to mental health support and ensure it\u2019s properly funded.\n\nThat\u2019s why I need your support on Thursday 12th December \u2013 so you get an MP helping to build a brighter future for Sheffield Hallam and to tackle the injustice of mental health care provision.\n\nBest Wishes,\nLaura Gordon"
