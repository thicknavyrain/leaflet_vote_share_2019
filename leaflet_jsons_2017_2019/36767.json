You can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson with our NHS. GP numbers are falling, the number of people waiting for an operation or treatment has trebled, and the waiting list for operations has reached a record 4.4 million. Labour created the NHS. We will always give the NHS the money and support it needs."

It was \u2018the Tories\u2019 devastating cuts and almost a decade of austerity that drove me out of teaching in the first place. If Labour is elected to form the next government, we will invest in a National Education Service to address the crisis in teaching, ensuring teachers are well supported and resources are in place for every child to succeed, regardless of their background or where they live. Labour will make life better for working families. For the 4 and 7-year-olds starting school this year, Labour will reduce class sizes to under 30, halve the money families spend on school uniforms and introduce free school meals for all primary school children."
