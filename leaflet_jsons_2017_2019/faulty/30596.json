The Conservative Government under Theresa May has proposed to change the way they fund schools and this could mean some big reductions in money for our schools in our local community. Recently released figures based on the Department for Education\u2019s data and information from the National Audit Office show every school in Rushcliffe will lose out. The reduction in funding would hit our school\u2019s core budget, which pays for all running costs. Costs for schools are already rising, and your local Conservative Member of Parliament, Ken Clarke has been silent on this issue and its impact on local schools. As your Labour Parliamentary Candidate I am opposing these proposals. Theresa May\u2019s Government should be investing in our local schools and children."

If these Government proposals are approved and taking into account inflation and things like rising numbers of pupils and other costs, the effect on Nottinghamshire schools would be a total loss of \u00a339.6 million by 2019 - an average of \u00a3384 per pupil. This means bigger classes, loss of teaching posts, reduced school staff, and cuts to extra-curricular activities and resources."
