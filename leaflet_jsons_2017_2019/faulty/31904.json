At the last election, the Scottish Conservative vote in Midlothian increased by more than 13% while the SNP dropped by 16%. It\u2019s closer. No matter who you usually vote for, a vote for the Scottish Conservatives this time is the only way to send the SNP a message they can\u2019t ignore. Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold another independence referendum next year \u2013 your vote can stop her. Again and again, Nicola Sturgeon has been told we don\u2019t want another referendum, but she just won\u2019t listen. If the SNP win here in Midlothian, Nicola Sturgeon will have another mandate for her referendum. And if Jeremy Corbyn is Prime Minister, he has said he would not stop a second referendum. This election is our chance to get the Scottish Conservatives can stop Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s independence referendum. The stakes really could not be higher. A win for the SNP in Midlothian is another mandate for her referendum next year."
