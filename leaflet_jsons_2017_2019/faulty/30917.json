I'm born in Withington Hospital, went to school and university locally, and have always lived and worked here. Being a politician, I've worked in the community \u2013 as an event manager and DJ. I've been active in our community for many years \u2013 as a school governor at two local schools, as a Housing Trust board member, and member of local community groups. I served locally as a City Councillor for Old Moat ward. As lead Councillor for Education, I led the rebuilding of our local schools under a Labour Government, and I also took a lead on regeneration issues and the campaign for jobs for our area. Public service is of great value to our staff. But I also had to deal with the incredibly difficult decisions forced on us by this Tory/Lib Dem Coalition. The only way to stop them is a strong Labour Party in parliament, fighting for a fairer society."
