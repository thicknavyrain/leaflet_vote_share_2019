The stakes at this election could not be higher.\nA vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and demand the right to choose a better future for Scotland.\nFor almost a decade, Tory governments have cut taxes for the rich and cut services for the rest of us. Now a Tory government is dragging Scotland out of the EU, weakening protection for our environment and threatening our economic future whilst trying to turn our NHS into an American style insurance system.\nThe SNP will stand up to the Tories and protect vital local services. We will work with others to stop Brexit and give you the final say over any deal.\nYour SNP vote is vital to give us the power to choose a better future. The chaos at Westminster has left people scunnered. Only the SNP is clear about having a bold, radical, and ambitious programme for a more equal and sustainable society.\nThe next Parliament should be a matter for the people who live here and the Scottish parliament they elect. The right to determine our own future should be a matter for you.\nWe have shared too much time and energy talking about Brexit when we should be fighting poverty and tackling climate change.\nI\u2019m proud of my work here on local issues and will not stop. I'll fight to defend our NHS and make sure that the minimum wage, a fairer tax system and more spending on vital public services.\nEdinburgh East has an amazing range of people with talent for so many things. Scotland\u2019s future has so much potential and I want to give us the opportunity to fulfil that. It\u2019s time to take control of our own future.\nVote SNP on December 12th!\nTommy Sheppard\n"
