But just remember the opinion polls got the General Election wrong in 2015. They got the EU referendum wrong, and as Jeremy Corbyn has said himself, he was a 200-1 outside chance for the Labour leadership. So in the days of shock election results and global uncertainty, no one can ever really be sure who will win. And with so much at stake, let's not risk it."

And the only way to back me is by voting Conservative in your local constituency of Plymouth Sutton and Devonport. A vote to back me is a vote for strong and stable leadership in the national interest. And your interest, too. A vote to back me is a vote to strengthen my negotiating position, to ensure we get the best Brexit deal possible. And a vote to back me is a vote to guarantee our economic security for the future. So Glen, please give me your backing and your vote. Together we can get on with the job of making life better for all of us."

Making Brexit a success is central to our national interest \u2013 and it is central to your own security and prosperity. While there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we do not get this right the consequences will be serious. And they will be felt by ordinary, working people across the country. If we don\u2019t get the Brexit deal right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk, and the opportunities you seek for your family will simply not happen. But with your help Glen, together we can get it right."

That means delivering better paying jobs, more affordable housing, a good school place for every child, and a strong economy paying for a strong NHS. But our opponents are already seeking to ruin our chances of getting the best Brexit deal. That is why I needed to make the decision to call a General Election for 8th June - to ask for your backing, so that when I am sitting around the table with the leaders of the 27 other EU countries I have the strongest negotiating hand possible. Remember, there are only two people who can possibly be Prime Minister after the election to negotiate Brexit \u2013 me, or Jeremy Corbyn."

A hung parliament and coalition of chaos will threaten our Brexit negotiations, and every single one of us will pay for it in higher taxes, fewer jobs, more waste and more debt."
