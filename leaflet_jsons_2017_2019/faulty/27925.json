It's also been a daily struggle against a Tory government that has turned us into the food bank capital of Britain and stretched our NHS to breaking point. Now Theresa May has broken her promise not to call an early election. She's after a blank cheque for more unfair cuts and a reckless hard Brexit that will endanger jobs and public services in the North East. Newcastle Central needs an MP who will stand up for our jobs and public services at this critical time. A vote for me is a vote for a strong local voice who always put Newcastle first. Thank you for your support in the past. I hope I can count on it when you cast your vote on June the 8th. With best wishes, Chi Onwurah"
