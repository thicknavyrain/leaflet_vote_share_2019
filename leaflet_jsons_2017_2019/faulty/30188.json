Almost three decades later I still meet people who speak fondly of Ian\u2019s time in Parliament and his commitment to local people.\n\nI am not a very party political animal. However, I hope you will understand why I am moved to write to you today. The dangers posed to our country by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party are too great to ignore.\n\nThere are only two possible outcomes to tomorrow\u2019s election - a majority Conservative Government led by Theresa May or a coalition of Labour, Lib Dems and Scottish Nationalists which will put Jeremy Corbyn into 10 Downing Street.\n\nWe live in an increasingly dangerous world. Our country faces difficult choices as we deal with terrorism and Britain\u2019s opportunities as we leave the European Union. More than ever we need strong leadership and a stable Government which only the Conservatives can provide.\n\nThe only way to achieve this in Eastbourne is to Vote Conservative. I urge you to support Caroline Ansell tomorrow."
