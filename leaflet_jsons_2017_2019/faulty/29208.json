Kevin Brennan has been missing in action far too often; he did very little on the Local Development Plan and its disastrous consequences and has played no part in local campaigns like re-open Waungron. Wales’ biggest challenge now is Brexit, yet our Cardiff West MP has been absent from an astonishing 6 out of 7 key votes on Brexit. Since 2010 we have seen a sea change in politics in Cardiff West. The Conservatives have slipped to a poor third in the last two elections. The 2017 Conservative candidate doesn’t even live in the constituency and last stood in Bethnal Green and Bow.... in London! Only the Party of Wales can challenge Labour here."
