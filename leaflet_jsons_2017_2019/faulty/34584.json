That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to you today to ask you to think carefully about how you vote on 12 December.\n\nYou can\u2019t trust Boris Johnson to properly fund our schools. Conservative cuts mean many head teachers are barely able to keep their schools\u2019 budgets afloat. Teachers are committed to giving the kids they teach as much as they can, but with time and budgets stretched, they are often digging into their own pockets to provide their students with the basics, there\u2019s a limit to what they\u2019ve got left to give.\n\nOn 12 December I\u2019ll be voting Labour. For investment in our children\u2019s futures, for an education system, that\u2019s free to use from cradle to grave, and for 30 hours\u2019 free childcare for all two to four year olds, so every child has the best start in life and parents get the support they need.\n\nLots of people think Brexit is the only thing that matters at this election, but there\u2019s any number of other issues at stake too. Please think about our children\u2019s futures when you cast your vote on 12 December."
