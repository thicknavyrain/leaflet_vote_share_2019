Labour are too weak and divided to oppose the Conservatives. Only Tim Farron's Liberal Democrats are strong enough to stand up to stop a Hard Brexit and keep Britain in the Single Market. Every Conservative MP elected will be a boost for Hard Brexit and give Theresa May a blank cheque to make that happen. Further cuts to our schools and NHS. We can't let that happen. The only way to send a message to the Conservatives that they are taking the country in the wrong direction is to back the Lib Dems in this election."
