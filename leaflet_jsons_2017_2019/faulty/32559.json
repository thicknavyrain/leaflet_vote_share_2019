But, for decades under the Labour party and the previous MP, that potential has remained untapped and our town has suffered badly. That has to change. I\u2019m proud that, at the local level, the Green Party has ended the days of one-party rule in Birkenhead. That has forced the council to pay us far more attention. We now need the same energy and the same fresh thinking from a new MP with a proven track record of achievement for Birkenhead."
