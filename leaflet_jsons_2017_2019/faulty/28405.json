However, MPs voted to dissolve Parliament by a large majority. Theresa called the election because having triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will lead to the United Kingdom leaving the EU, she feared there were forces in Westminster determined to disrupt her plans to negotiate a good deal for our country post Brexit."
