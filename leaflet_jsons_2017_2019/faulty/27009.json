                "content": "Can you remember how you felt after the referendum in June? Like most people in London, I voted for Remain and was proud to do so. As it became clear that Leave had won, I was heartbroken and fearful for our country\u2019s future. I feared the effect Brexit would have on our economy. So many of our biggest employers - from car manufacturers to financial services - rely heavily on our close relationship with Europe. Rather than concentrate on making the best of a bad situation by safeguarding investment and jobs, the Government is dragging Britain towards the hardest possible Brexit. If the Conservatives get a huge majority on 8th June, then it will be more of the same. This election is our chance to change the direction of our country. We need a strong opposition that will stand up for our NHS and local schools - both of which face more damaging cuts under the Conservatives. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party are in disarray and are going backwards everywhere. They won\u2019t even oppose leaving the single market. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for your vote. As your Lib Dem MP, I will stand up for our NHS and local schools. I will vote against any Brexit deal which makes Britain outside the single market. I will call for a referendum on the terms of any deal, with an option to remain in the EU. Give me your support and reject the politics of fear and isolation from this Conservative Government. Thank you."
