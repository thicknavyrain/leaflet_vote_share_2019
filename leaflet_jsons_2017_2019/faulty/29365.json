                "content": "Dear friend,\nMy name is Dr Dean Eggitt and I'm a GP here in Yorkshire. I'm getting in touch with you because I care passionately about our health service. I'm deeply worried about the direction it's been heading under the Tory government, and I'm fearful for its future if we don't have strong Labour MPs fighting for it here in Yorkshire.\n\nThe health service I\u2019m so proud to work in is one of Britain's greatest ever achievements, and it\u2019s envied and copied around the world. But the truth is that it's under an unprecedented amount of pressure \u2013 our NHS is in crisis.\n\nPeople are having to wait days if not weeks to get an appointment with their own GP. There are queues for patients waiting on trolleys in NHS departments. These are scenes I\u2019d hoped we had left behind in Thatcher's Britain decades ago.\n\nThe Tory decision to scrap targets the last Labour government put in place means patients are waiting months for cancer treatment, as well as for hip replacements, cataracts and life-saving operations. The Tory response to all this was to claim the pressures on the NHS were merely a small number of incidents when in reality the NHS is dangerously under-resourced. It defies belief.\n\nAnd now it's got worse. One of the biggest threats in the pressure on our health service under the Tories is social care. Our government made a grave strategy to make sure older people with mobility problems and dementia get the care they need.\n\nSo I was horrified when I saw the Tory manifesto\u2019s plans to make people pay for their care using the value of their family homes. People who have worked hard all their lives shouldn't be punished for being ill and not be able to leave their home to their children.\n\nJust when you think it can't get any worse, the Tories have announced that if they win the election they'll cut the Winter Fuel Allowance \u2013 millions of pensioners could lose out, potentially meaning more elderly people having to choose between heating and. (the rest is unclear)\n\nYou can't trust the Tories to look after our NHS, and you certainly can't trust them on social care either.\n\nYour Labour candidate will be a strong voice in parliament for our health service and for social care. Labour is the only party pledging to stop the Tory programme (the rest is unclear)\n\nI hope that you will put our NHS first this Thursday, 8th June, and join me in voting Labour. Best wishes,\nDr Dean Eggitt GP"
