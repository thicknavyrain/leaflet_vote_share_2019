She understands the damage Brexit could do to all our futures. Johnson\u2019s deal is the start of negotiations on our future, not the end! Brexit will dominate our lives for years and years if we don\u2019t stop it now. The Lib Dems have shown they will work across the party divides to bring you a greener, fairer society. Voting Lib Dem is voting for a party that is ready to govern this country and will protect your jobs, your rights, and your planet. It\u2019s time for a better choice than Johnson or Corbyn. Jo Swinson has shown clear and principled leadership on the most important issue of our time. Vote Lib Dem and build a brighter future for our children. A vote for Meri is a vote for a proven local champion. Make sure your voice is heard and lend her your vote."
