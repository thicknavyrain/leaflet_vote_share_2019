The Tories had promised to protect school funding, but in every constituency in Stoke-on-Trent, every school is facing a real-terms cut in their budgets. As pupil numbers grow, the extra cash needed isn\u2019t coming forward. In the worst cases, schools in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire are asking parents for a small fee every term to keep the lights on and some school reduces costs. Gareth said, \u201cOur children are rich in talent and potential, but that future is being stolen from them by a Conservative Government that is refusing to give our kids the education they deserve.\u201d"
