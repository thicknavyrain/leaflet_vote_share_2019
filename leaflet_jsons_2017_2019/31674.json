I was proud to campaign alongside Julian Huppert and David Howarth. Both packed a serious punch on the national stage, as well as being highly respected constituency MPs. Their voice was always prominent, and I believe that Cambridge\u2019s next MP must match and surpass their ability to lead the way with bold, progressive ideas. If our city's MP isn\u2019t speaking up each and every day about how we stop Brexit, tackle the climate emergency head on and combat inequality, they\u2019re not doing their job properly. And, with several national crises upon us, we need that now more than ever before. As your MP, I\u2019ll be a shining beacon for the progressive values we all hold dear. That means leading from the front and moving the debate forward, both in Parliament and across the country. On Brexit. On the climate emergency. On inequality. With your support, I will be the strong, influential voice our city is crying out for. Standing up for our shared values and punching above our weight at a local and national level. Many thanks, Rod Cantrill PS. We need a return to the days when Cambridge\u2019s voice packed a punch well beyond our city's border. As your MP, I will lead the national debate, not just follow it."
