Whether you voted Remain or Leave in the EU referendum, we now need the best deal for Scotland. We will stand up for Edinburgh\u2019s financial sector, universities and NHS in the Brexit negotiations. And we\u2019ll fight for our pensioners, now that the Tories are threatening to cut the state pension. Be in no doubt \u2013 a Conservative government will spend the next five years implementing policies like the Bedroom Tax or the Rape Clause, neither of which Scotland voted for. Our group of MPs has been the real opposition at Westminster since 2015. We want to continue that job. Here in Edinburgh West, the Tories are back. In last year\u2019s Scottish election (Regional List vote) they pushed the Lib Dems into third place. Only the SNP can stop them. Labour are hopelessly weak and divided. The Lib Dems u-turned on every policy they believed in when in government. And their candidate for Edinburgh West has stood for election all over Scotland desperately trying to get elected \u2013 anywhere."
