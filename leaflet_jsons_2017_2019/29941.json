                "content": "On Thursday you have a choice to make. It is a choice between a Labour government that works for the many and a Conservative government that serves the privileged few.\n\nDuring the election campaign I've travelled across the country speaking with people and hearing about their hopes and concerns. I have enjoyed every conversation, but one thing is clear: many people feel they are being held back.\n\nThe Tories have broken their promises, millions are faced with falling living standards and growing job insecurity, whilst those at the top receive tax breaks.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. This election can be the chance for a fresh start with a Labour government.\n\nA Labour government will build a fairer Britain. We will: \n\n- Invest in an economy that puts working people first. We will introduce a Real Living Wage of \u00a310 an hour by 2020 and provide equal rights at work from day one.\n- Give the NHS the funding it needs. We will immediately halt all Tory hospital closure plans and take one million people off NHS waiting lists. And we will fund free car parking at NHS hospitals for patients, visitors and NHS staff.\n- Create opportunity for all. We will abolish university tuition fees, introduce free school meals for all primary school children and cut class sizes.\n- Stand up for our communities. We will hire an extra 10,000 police officers in England and Wales and give stronger rights to victims of crime.\n- Ensure security and dignity in retirement. We will guarantee the Triple Lock on pensions and ensure there is no rise in the State Pension age beyond 66. Labour will also keep Winter Fuel Payments and we will invest \u00a38 billion in social care over the next parliament."
