But during my six years as an NHS psychiatrist, it\u2019s become clear to me there is an imbalance at the heart of the way our NHS treats patients.\n\nFor far too long mental health has been put on the back-burner and I\u2019m frightened by this. I\u2019m frightened for all the young people unable to access adequate services and I\u2019m frightened that patients are all too often turned away.\n\nBut most of all I\u2019m angry \u2013 angry that patients suffering with severe mental health needs are waiting on average 14 weeks for an assessment alone \u2013 far longer than the time for patients with physical ailments.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m backing the Liberal Democrats in this election. Their plan to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health treatment is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year will ensure we have the mental health service and care Britain needs."
