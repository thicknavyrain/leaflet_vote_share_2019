Boris Johnson stood up for the UK and has secured a good deal. A deal that takes us out of the EU and puts us in control of our money, laws and borders. And a deal that allows us to strike new trade agreements with the rest of the world. A vote for the Conservatives will help deliver Brexit so we can move onto important domestic issues. A Conservative vote means supporting a successful economy providing additional funds for the NHS, education, law and order and many other public services. It\u2019s time to get Brexit done and move on."
