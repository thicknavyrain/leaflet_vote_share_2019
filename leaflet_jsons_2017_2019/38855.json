Waiting times for mental health services are, on average, 14 weeks - just for an assessment - before support and care has even begun. Problems that can start small, become crises as help is either not available, or arrives late. The Liberal Democrats have a plan to tackle this. They have pledged to ringfence funding investment into services. They will also ensure services run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Liberal Democrats will increase mental health staffing and will ensure that, by 2025, 100% of children and young people with diagnosable conditions get NHS treatment."

Both Boris Johnson's Conservative party and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party are determined to pursue Brexit. But whether it's a Conservative or a Labour Brexit it would be catastrophic for the UK. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit. Stopping Brexit means that we can focus on tackling the big issues facing the UK right now. Our economy will grow more quickly, providing a Remain Bonus that we will invest in our public services. Once we stop Brexit, we can build a brighter future where we tackle the climate emergency and properly fund schools and the NHS, and create opportunity for all."
