To begin Brexit negotiations in the EU, the country needs strong and stable leadership. When she goes into bat for Britain, she deserves the strongest possible mandate. In the last year I have had two main priorities: to ensure that we make leaving the EU feel fair and respected, and to get United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust to reopen Grantham A&E at nights. That is why I left hospital in a wheelchair to vote for Article 50. And in March organised a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the unacceptable situation at Grantham Hospital."
