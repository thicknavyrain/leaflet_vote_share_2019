                "content": "I am asking the electors of North Durham to vote for me at the General Election on 12th December. Over the last 18 years, I have striven to be North Durham's effective voice in Parliament, but also ensured that I have kept in touch with and helped with the problems facing individuals across the constituency. Brexit is a deeply divisive issue, which arouses strong passions on all sides. The Labour manifesto (on which I was elected in 2017) pledged the party to oppose a No Deal Brexit, which would be massively damaging to jobs and security. Throughout the debate, I have kept constituents updated with regular statements posted on my website, and if I am re-elected I will continue to do so. Since 2010, we have faced successive Government cuts deliberately targeting the elderly and the vulnerable in North Durham and across the country. I have been a strong opponent of Universal Credit in Parliament as it is simply not fit for purpose and provides no support at a time when people need it most. As a former Defence Minister, I am a strong supporter of our armed services, and am particularly focused on ensuring that our Veterans get the recognition and practical help which they deserve. In Parliament I have been a passionate advocate for eradicating the stigma around mental health and ensuring sufferers get their fair share of NHS resources. I also work closely with local grassroots organisations to support individuals and families facing health problems of all types. I am always happy to meet with people to discuss any issues that may concern them - please do get in touch if you would like to speak to me in person. Best wishes Kevan"
