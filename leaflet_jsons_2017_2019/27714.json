One I met recently was in charge of construction of the new BBC Wales HQ, one came to the Commons to lobby me on policy and another went on to manage one of the biggest bands in the world! I didn't dream of all this when I was helping my colleagues become the first comprehensive school in Wales. Education is the foundation of Cardiff West.'"
