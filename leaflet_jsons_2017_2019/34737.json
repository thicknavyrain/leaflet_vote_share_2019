For three and a half years opposition has been unrelenting from the well-funded Remain lobby and our political elite. The vote to Leave was the largest ever vote in the UK's history, and by deliberate obstruction it is not being delivered. This is indeed the Brexit election, but more importantly this is about defending democracy itself.
