                "content": "Now we know there is an election on Thursday 12th December, I am asking you to vote for me so I can continue to fight for you. I\u2019m as frustrated as you, with three general elections over four years, all forced on us by poor Prime Ministers unable to lead an extreme Tory Party that\u2019s obsessed with Europe. In fact, when I look at all the things that matter to local families I\u2019m angry that we have to spend time campaigning instead of getting things right here for our community and country. I\u2019m made and brought up here. I know my way around and am used to getting things done. But now there is so much anger and uncertainty about the electorate all around. Things will always be tough, but I\u2019m also worried by extremists trying to force the UK into a bad no-deal Brexit, an outcome that Boris Johnson told us would be easy, but that has made things worse, and has never been the will of the majority. I know many in the country voted for Brexit because they were angry that no one paid the price for the crash in 2008, and were convinced that nothing could better their economic prospects. To change things for the people the decisions we need to make are not linked to Brexit. It\u2019s about how we make their lives better. They say things were broken \u2013 poor wages, rising crime, longer NHS waiting lists, rocketing housing costs \u2013 and wanted them fixed. But Brexit hasn\u2019t solved any of those problems; instead they are getting worse, not better. And nor do I think a general election right now will fix any of these problems. That\u2019s going to take hard work by our elected representatives after a general election certainly not going to fix Brexit. I believe Brexit can only be resolved, clear and fair, by the people. After 22 years as your Member of Parliament, I\u2019m sure you know by now that I don\u2019t follow the fashions of the day. I will always speak out and put this community first, irrespective of the impact on my own political career. That\u2019s why I have spent this year campaigning for what\u2019s \u2018Right.\u2019 I am determined for Mitcham and Morden on the local level and our national way forward. I have a clear plan to improve Mitcham and Morden that covers; better housing; raising money for fair school places; standing up for local police officers and the protection class of St. Helier hospital as a top service. St. George\u2019s from the knock-on impact of changing roles and cuts to ambulance services and possible selling off. Going to care for our kids by raising money for safe places to play, better jobs and skills training for those out of work and fair pay for low-paid stuff. I\u2019ll give more time to it all in much better ways since some things can go to the hands of hardworking volunteers and reach beyond my Morden office."
