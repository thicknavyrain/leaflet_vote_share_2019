This will have a huge impact on our already stretched road network. It is a ticking time bomb waiting for Cardiff West\u2019s workers, trying to get around Cardiff to earn a living. The Green Wedges within the Cardiff West boundary lack sufficient protection to remain as spaces for residents to access for recreation and exercise. The Local Development Plan needs an urgent review. I will press Cardiff Council to undertake this review. Residents across the constituency have been giving me the same message - That Labour just isn't listening. For years, Labour has taken our vote for granted. Labour isn\u2019t working hard for the residents of Cardiff West. It's time to make that change. It's time to vote Conservative."
