If re-elected, I promise to continue to serve the community which I grew up in. As the mother of a young family, I have seen first-hand the impact of Conservative cuts on our families. I will fight to properly fund our schools, daycare and transport services. I promise to protect our local jobs and public services from Tory cuts and unsafe trade deals. Only a majority Labour Government can end the crisis in our NHS. Our policies will deliver a fairer society. This time, every vote for Labour counts. Please don't leave it to chance. Please use your vote so we can elect a Labour Government which will deliver for the many not the few. I hope you will support me and Labour in the upcoming election."
