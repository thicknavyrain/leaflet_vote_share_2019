Re-elect me if you want a public vote on Brexit and to remain in the EU. Together, we saved Charing Cross Hospital. Now, after 10 years of Conservative austerity, we need to invest in our NHS, schools and police. We must build more affordable homes. We must make the UK carbon neutral by 2030. Only Labour can stop the Conservatives in Hammersmith. Vote for me on 12 December."
