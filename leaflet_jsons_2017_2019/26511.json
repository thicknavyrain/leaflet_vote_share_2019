My family moved to the East End from Bangladesh when I was seven. I went to Mulberry School on Commercial Road, and Tower Hamlets College. I love the East End: its history, its heritage, and its people. I have dedicated my life to working on issues that matter to people: jobs, housing, education, health, security and tackling poverty. As your MP, I will continue to stand up for local people, fight for decent homes, for more teachers and smaller class sizes, for world-class hospitals and social care for our elderly. Most of all, I will fight for local jobs and opportunities. I campaigned to remain in the European Union and voted in Parliament against triggering Article 50. I will fight to protect people from the Tories\u2019 \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 which threatens jobs and prosperity. Things are changing fast in the East End. We are proud of our past, but we must face the future. That means giving our young people the skills they need and giving them the opportunities to get on in life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m standing to be your MP once again. I would be honoured if you supported me on Thursday 8th June.",
