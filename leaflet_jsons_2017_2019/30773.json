I will never be scared to stand up for the things I believe in and the place I live. On current national polling the Conservatives would win again in Erewash \u2013 leaving us with a Conservative Borough Council, a Conservative County Council, a Conservative Government and a Conservative MP. It is worth considering that for a moment. No one locally to challenge government plans for more cuts to our NHS, social care, schools, the police and other public services. No one to hold the account of all the broken promises they made in 2015 to balance the books and cut taxes. No one to stand up for jobs, investment and living standards as we exit the EU. If you believe it\u2019s important for the health of our democracy to have someone at Westminster providing real challenge, I hope that, whatever your normal political colour, you will consider voting for me in Erewash in this election. When you vote on June 8th you are electing the person you want to be your local MP for the next five years. I hope you put your trust in me to be your voice and stand up for local people. Yours sincerely, Catherine Atkinson"
