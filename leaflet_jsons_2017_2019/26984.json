This isn't what I want for my children or my country. Isolation isn\u2019t good for Britain. Being outside the single market isn't good for Britain. Ignoring the damage that hard Brexit does to jobs, food prices and industry isn't good for Britain. This election is our chance to get the strong opposition Britain needs. That's why I'm asking you to support the Liberal Democrats this time. The fight to stop a hard Brexit isn't over. The people, not Theresa May, can and should have the final say on the Brexit deal in a referendum. That's what we\u2019ll be fighting for with your support. A vote for the Lib Dems is also a vote to stop more harsh cuts to our NHS and our schools. It's a vote against heartless cuts to benefits for bereaved families. When Labour had the chance to stand up to this Government on Brexit they failed. I thought the Labour Party shared our values of openness and tolerance - but instead they\u2019ve left many of their supporters feeling angry and betrayed. Please join with me and help change Britain\u2019s future in this election. Thanks and best wishes, Tim Farron"
