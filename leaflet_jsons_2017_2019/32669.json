It shows that 76% of voters think of themselves primarily as Leavers or Remainers. By contrast only 15% identify strongly with any political party. So, the choice is clear: do you want a Brexiteer or a Remainer MP? In many key seats, that's a starlight choice between The Brexit Party and Jeremy Corbyn's Remainer Labour."

There are around 130 parliamentary seats which the Conservatives have not won for at least 50 years and will not win in this election. In many of these seats, a Leaver\u2019s vote for the Conservative Party would be a wasted vote. It will risk letting in another Labour MP who backs a second referendum and wants us to Remain. In the European elections defeat Corbyn's Labour in its heartlands. The Brexit Party proved that we can win there: we won the European Elections in May, winning almost every Leave-voting region with more votes than the Conservatives and Labour put together. Tactical voting could be big in this election. In seats where only The Brexit Party can beat the Remainers, every Brexiter should vote for us."

We want to invest in the NHS to overcome health inequalities between North and South. This election is an opportunity to change politics for good by putting Brexit MPs into Parliament. There can be no real Brexit without The Brexit Party to ensure it happens. Do you want a Brexiteer or a Remainer for your MP? The Brexit Party can beat Corbyn\u2019s Remainer Labour and stop their second referendum plot. Leavers, don\u2019t waste your vote."
