This puts patients at risk, in spite of the best efforts of an overstretched and underpaid NHS workforce who have not had a real pay rise in years. Now the Tories have instructed their candidates to refuse to sign pledges promising not to privatise the NHS or to include it in any trade deal. Why? Because President Trump has already stated that everything, including our NHS, would be on the table in any negotiations. A vote for Labour is a vote to stop our NHS being sold off to the highest bidder. Mohammad Yasin and Labour believe that the NHS works best when it is run for patients and not for profit. Labour has a plan to save our NHS and improve healthcare in the UK. We will fully fund our NHS and reverse all traces of privatisation form it. We will reintroduce the nursing bursary and increase GP training places so that there are more life-saving staff to reduce the pressures on our NHS. We will end the scourge of prescription fees, making sure that nobody is ever again prevented from accessing the treatment they need."
