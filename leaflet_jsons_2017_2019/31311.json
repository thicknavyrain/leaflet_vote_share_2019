Both the Conservatives and Labour are stuck in the past, failing time and again to deliver a better future. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We have an ambitious plan for the future of our country, where every person, every community, and our planet can thrive. A Liberal Democrat government will stop Brexit and build a brighter future. Please use your vote on 12th December to vote Liberal Democrat and build a brighter future. Best wishes, Jo Swinson."
