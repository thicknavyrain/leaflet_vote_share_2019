Nine years of austerity, cuts to our local services, have devastated our community. The Tories cut police officers, so now we see crime rising. They cut nurses and funds for the Doctor. They cut youth services, the very people there to help young people do better. Alex has always done that and is the only candidate that has a strong local record. Lives here and we can win."
