In uncertain times we need big bold ideas to build a future we can all believe in. Like Bristol, I am proud to do politics differently.\nI'm an economist and since 2014 I have been your Member of the European Parliament. On your behalf, I campaigned strongly to keep us in the EU. I've worked to close tax loopholes, ensuring large corporations and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes. With other Green MEPs I have called on the government to halt the US called TTIP that would have put our NHS at huge risk. I'm qualified, courageous and I get things done.\nThese are my pledges to you:\n\u2022 I will campaign for your right to vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal, including the option to stay in the EU;\n\u2022 I will resist any Tory bonfire of human rights and environmental protections, fight to protect freedom of movement and keep us in the single market;\n\u2022 I will work with other MPs to reverse the privatization of the NHS and pass Caroline Lucas' NHS Reinstatement Bill. If passed, this bill would win back thirteen billion pounds for the NHS every year, and stop profits being made from our health;\n\u2022 I will push for genuinely affordable, warm homes for everyone, campaign for rent controls and living rents and enforce minimum standards for landlords.\nThe Green Party is united behind me. The next parliament needs an MP who will support Labour on all the good things they stand for, and oppose Brexit.\nThank you for your support. For the Green Party to win this seat would take just a 5% swing. I'm asking you to be bold and vote for a strong, independent voice for Bristol. Caroline Lucas has shown how much as an MP, for her constituency and for Britain. Imagine what we can achieve together as your Green MP. Vote Green on 8th June and help us make history.\nYours sincerely,\nMolly"
