Brexit would only make things worse, and I'm committed to campaigning for 'remain' in a future vote on a Brexit deal \u2013 which only a Labour government can guarantee.\nVoting Tory or Lib Dem is a vote for more of the same. Labour offers this country the change it needs.\nA Labour government will deliver:\n\u2022 A Final Say vote on the Brexit deal. Only a vote for Labour can guarantee this.\n\u2022 Housing for all - 1 million new houses and more protection for renters\n\u2022 A Green Industrial Revolution- investment in new green industries to create thousands of high-skilled jobs and help stop climate change\n\u2022 Public safety \u2013 Gtr M/cr Police have lost 2000 officers since 2010. Labour will reverse these cuts.\n\u2022 Protect our NHS \u2013 The proper investment our health service needs, and we\u2019ll stop any Trump style trade deal that sells off our services."
