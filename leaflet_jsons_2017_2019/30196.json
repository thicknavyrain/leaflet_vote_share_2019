I was elected as your MP on a promise of standing up for Stoke-on-Trent, getting the best deal for the Potteries and holding the Tories to account. As someone who has been loyal to Labour in the past, I want to thank you and let you know that if you vote for me on the 8th June, I will be loyal to you as your Labour MP. Stoke-on-Trent faces many challenges over the next few years, none more so than making sure we get the Brexit deal we need here rather than getting the scraps from any deals made for London."
