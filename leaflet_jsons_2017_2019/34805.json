Your local Labour MP has ignored the views of her constituents and has voted in Parliament to frustrate Brexit. I will back Boris to get Brexit done. I am pleased that Boris has pledged more money for the NHS. Good healthcare, free at the point of use, is a principle I will always defend. I appreciate the value of the NHS. My Grandmother moved down south from Yorkshire to become a nurse after the war. We need more police locally to fight crime and keep our streets safe. I welcome Boris\u2019s pledge of 20,000 extra police officers. In my role as a councillor, I have promoted closer working between police and community stakeholders.",
