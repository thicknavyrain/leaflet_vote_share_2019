I went to a poor performing comprehensive school and was the first person in my family to go to university. I have spent the last 16 years running organisations that improve education and employment opportunities for people across the country. I now want to ensure that everyone in this constituency has the chance to raise their education and employment opportunities, and that children, whatever their background, are helped to get a better start to their adult life, a good job or to grow their local business - all of which needs us to have better infrastructure. From Faringdon to Wallingford and everywhere in between I am here to be a strong voice for you in Parliament. I look forward to catching up with you soon so we can discuss the concerns you might have and how I can help you. Help me make our constituency a better place to live, work and bring up children. Yours sincerely, David Johnston Your Conservative Parliamentary Candidate for Wantage."
