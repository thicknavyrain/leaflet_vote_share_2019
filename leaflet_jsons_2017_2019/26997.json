It is vital there is strong opposition to avoid giving Theresa May a blank cheque for the future. I am the strong voice in Cambridge.\nIf re-elected on June 8 I will carry on where I left off and fight every day both here and in Westminster to secure a better deal for Cambridge and to champion Cambridge's values.\nPlease give me your support and help me work to avoid a damaging Brexit and protect our NHS and schools from extreme cuts.\n\nKind regards,\nJulian Huppert\nP.S. You face a clear choice on June 8th: Jeremy Corbyn's Labour candidate or a hard-working local MP who will fight hard to change the future direction of our country."
