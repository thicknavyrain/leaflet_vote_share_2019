Our future prosperity, our place in the world, and our standard of living all depend on getting the Brexit deal right.\n\nAnd with your help, together we can make it work.\n\nWe will:\n\u2713 Take back control of our borders, our laws and our money\n\u2713 Sign new trade deals around the world with old friends and new partners\n\u2713 Ensure we leave in a smooth and orderly way, and that Brexit works for you and the whole of the United Kingdom\n\u2713 Provide as much clarity as possible at every stage of the process, while maintaining a strong negotiating hand\n\nGetting Brexit right matters because it will decide whether or not our children have a safe, secure and prosperous future.\n\nBecause only with a good deal from Brexit can we keep our growing economy and all the public services we rely on: well-paid jobs, more affordable housing, a good school place for every child, and a strong economy paying for a strong NHS.\n\nThe only way you can ensure we have the strong and stable leadership to get this right is by backing me, and voting for my Conservative candidate in your local area."
