We know that the Tories are pushing our NHS into a state of crisis and underfunding our schools while cutting taxes for the well off. They don't understand the pressures facing many families locally. And they have failed to invest in housing, skills or transport to help ensure the future growth and economic success of our city. As your MP, I have always stood up for our community, worked hard to help you through my regular advice surgeries and represented Leeds with passion. I have campaigned for better broadband across Leeds, won more funding for improved flood defenses for the city centre and supported many voluntary organisations right across the city - from Woodhouse to Middleland and from Burmantofts to Beeston and Holbeck. I do hope you will feel able to put your trust and confidence in me once again."
