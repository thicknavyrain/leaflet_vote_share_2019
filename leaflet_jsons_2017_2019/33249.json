These next five years are now down to you and your local vote here in Wallasey and Moreton.\n\nParliament has been stuck in the mud, unable to agree on anything except more arguments. But the country voted to leave the EU and we must deliver on that.\n\nSince the last election we've seen MPs who were elected on a promise to deliver Brexit, do everything possible to delay it.\n\nThat's one of the reasons why I am campaigning to give Wallasey a fresh start. Angela Eagle has been MP here for 27 years but every vote she receives this time is a vote for Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister.\n\nSo far, Jeremy Corbyn has been endorsed by Gerry Adams and Derek Hatton.\n\nThat tells you everything you need to know about today's Labour Party. Even Tony Benn's granddaughter has decided she can no longer support Labour.\n\nThere is an alternative.\n\nA vote for the Conservatives here in Wallasey is a vote to get Brexit done, with a deal that protects jobs and trade. \u00a333.9 billion extra for the NHS. 20,000 extra police officers. More funding for every pupil in every school. And a growing economy to pay for it.\n\nWhen you go to vote please vote Conservative so we can get Brexit done and then focus on these issues.\n\nYou don't need a polling card to vote and you can vote anytime between 7am and 10pm. If you need any help on how or where to vote, please call the Town Hall's Elections Office on 0151 691 8046.\n\nYour local vote in Wallasey has never been more important and I want the chance to deliver a fresh start for us here."
