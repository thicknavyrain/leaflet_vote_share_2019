I grew up in Chapel St Leonards, went to Skegness Grammar School and have lived in Louth, teaching as a primary supply teacher, and now based in Grimsby as a librarian. I have also been involved in local campaigns to save our libraries and local environmental projects. Our current MP and Tory government have neglected public services, especially for those most in need... If you agree with us on these issues please give me your vote on December 12th. Your Labour candidate, Ellie Green."
