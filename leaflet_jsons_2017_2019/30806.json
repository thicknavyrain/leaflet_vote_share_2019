We have the vision to deliver an alternative future for our country \u2013 and our place in the world. The Green Party offers a different kind of politics. \n\n- To shape an economy for everyone while preserving a safe environment.\n- To build affordable homes and provide properly funded public services.\n- To put power back in your hands through a citizen\u2019s democracy.\n\nEvery Green vote on 8 June will help make that vision a reality. If you agree with us, stand with us. The Conservatives think they have this election sewn up. But it's in your hands. Stand with us for housing, schools, our NHS, our environment, and our future. We stand up for what matters. Vote Green Party on 8 June!"
