Are you concerned that our NHS is being cruelly cut and our local hospital now has a budget deficit of \u00a3211 million?\n\nThis election isn\u2019t only about deciding who will run our Country. It\u2019s also about choosing who you think will best fight for Colchester in Parliament! It\u2019s about choosing an MP who will support our local public services and won\u2019t go along with more Government cuts.\n\nThe Conservatives have broken their promises - on keeping our streets safe and on the NHS. For the last two years, the Government and its Essex MPs fell short on their pledge to fund the NHS. Instead, our Health Service is being cut and cut again!\n\nEven when communities everywhere they can take areas like ours for granted? This has to stop. Your vote is the only way to lend me their support this time. It\u2019s the only way to send politicians the message that we deserve better.\n\nIf I can win in Colchester, then the Government will have to listen - not just on proper funding for our Police in Essex, but on fairer funding for our local NHS too.\n\nDoctors and nurses in our NHS do a great job but they are not getting the support they need. The Government seems more interested in picking fights with Junior Doctors than fixing the ever-growing funding gap facing our NHS. Colchester Hospital is suffering because of underfunding. We need real action now.\n\nA vote for me will send a powerful message - on keeping our town safe, and on our support for our local NHS."
