Then in April comes the U turn and Theresa May announces a Snap Election in June. A month later, in May, the CPS decided the evidence is clear that the Electoral Commission was correct in its verdict but that insufficient evidence was found to support criminal charges against individuals. The Establishment tried to say UKIP are finished and we even had infiltrators into UKIP to try to sabotage us but UKIP\u2019s grass root members are ordinary people, we do not have multi millionaires financing us in return for favors. We have People Power. We do not represent the Working Class, Middle or Upper Class, we don\u2019t even represent the Vulnerable or the elite, we represent ALL the People of the UK: We want a fair society that helps people who need it and we want to save our British culture before greed and envy destroys the ambitions of our young."
