I am now offering myself for re-election as your Conservative Party candidate.\n\nThe Tewkesbury constituency is wide and diverse, taking in Tewkesbury town itself, Ashchurch, Bishop's Cleeve, Winchcombe, Prestbury, Swindon Village, Churchdown, Brockworth, Innsworth, Longlevens and a great many villages. During the last 22 years I have done my best to keep in touch with issues in each of these communities.\n\nI have held regular meetings with constituents, often visiting them in their homes. I've also paid regular visits to schools, community groups, businesses, farms, charities and other organisations. I have also been pleased to welcome people from these groups to Westminster.\n\nThis General Election is very important. I believe that we really do need to elect a majority Conservative government. We need to get Brexit done in the way I describe on this leaflet, so that no one is left behind. We also need to concentrate on other issues such as hospitals, schools, infrastructure, the police and so much more.\n\nWe can only fund these vital public services by having a strong economy, and that's what a Conservative government will provide. Handing the keys of 10 Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn will lead the country to ruin. Nor do we need to see any pacts among Labour, the LibDems and the SNP.\n\nBecause I am totally dedicated to the Tewkesbury constituency, and because we need a Conservative government, I am respectfully asking for your vote at the election. \nThank you,\nLaurence Robertson"
