To do this, we need you to vote for Stephanie Smith here in Edinburgh South. Many people feel fed up with politics and with this pointless election that didn't need to be called. It may be tempting to sit this one out or to let voting be an afterthought. But we must come together to stop the SNP and send them a message. The result here in Edinburgh South is already tight and resting on a knife-edge. We know it only takes a small number of votes, so your vote really counts. The stakes in this election are higher than ever before. The facts locally are clear too. In Edinburgh South, this is not a contest between Theresa May's Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. This can't be won by Labour or the Lib Dems here. The only way to stop the SNP is to vote Stephanie Smith. So come together to send Nicola Sturgeon a message she can't ignore."
