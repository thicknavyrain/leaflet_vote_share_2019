The EU friends of our politicians have tried every trick at their disposal to get the British people to change their minds\nUKIP was the first party to call for a genuine Brexit. No more unnecessary laws or taxes. No more surrendering to the unelected EU.\nTogether in this industry I can slowly weave my vision of bringing a Clean Break Brexit into reality. Vote Leave! Alistair"
