I want to be a strong and credible local MP - keeping our NHS safe from cuts and privatisation, protecting pensions and supporting local families. I can't just sit by as a local GP watching the NHS fall apart. People are unable to get an appointment with their doctor, waiting lists for surgery are increasing and our local hospital services are under threat of closure. I have a track record of improving services for people in my career as a doctor and health service leader. I would like to be able to represent local people in Stockton in Parliament and to be able to hold this government to account. The people of Stockton, Yarm, Thornaby, Ingleby Barwick and Eaglescliffe deserve better.",
