                "content": "I was born and raised in Newark and went to school here. I have spent the last 10 years in London where I have worked for organisations trying to tackle child poverty. My grandparents on my father\u2019s side were both born and raised in Newark. My father still lives here today. I have a passion for this area and want to make sure everyone who lives here has a safe and secure future. I know we can build a better future here together. Over the last 7 years, in organisations trying to tackle child poverty, I've seen first hand the damage that austerity has done to people across the country. I've campaigned with colleagues on issues such as health and education and I will do my best for all of us. Working together, we can build a better future for us all."
