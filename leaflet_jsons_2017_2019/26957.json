This winter saw the worst ever crisis for A&E departments. 1.2 million of our elderly people are not getting the care they need. 15% of operations are cancelled. We cannot let this vandalism go on any longer. That\u2019s why I am campaigning for the Liberal Democrats in this election. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to set out a clear plan to fund the NHS. A penny on income tax for the NHS will ease the pressure on NHS staff and patients until long-term solutions can be found. The future of the NHS is in your hands. Five more years of Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives will give them free reign for more and more cuts. Only a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote for confidence in our NHS. As an NHS doctor, I am fearful of the damage that would be done to the NHS by an all-powerful Conservative government.",
