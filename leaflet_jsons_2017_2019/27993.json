That\u2019s why I am committed to fighting for fair funding for our many local schools. The Labour Party has always fought for jobs. Labour will invest in infrastructure, skills and new technology so everyone has the opportunity to work in a well paid job. Only Labour will make work pay for hard working families by increasing the minimum wage to \u00a310 per hour, supporting young people to get the skills they need for the future and guaranteeing the protection of people\u2019s pensions. Labour is on the side of the working people of Rochester & Strood, low and middle wage earners, parents, pensioners, people with young children and people in training for their future careers. We will give working people a say in how their workplaces and communities are run so real people are represented and in control of the future. It\u2019s time for a change in Rochester and Strood.",
