Over the past few years I have met and helped thousands of people and for me, this is both the most rewarding and enjoyable part of my job. At the same time, I have campaigned passionately on behalf of our area in Parliament. I\u2019ve also secured major victories for local campaigners and have worked tirelessly for local businesses and voluntary groups. In fact, during the last Parliament, I had more recorded votes in the House of Commons than any other local Member of Parliament."
