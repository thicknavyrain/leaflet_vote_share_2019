But this is not a time to gamble on the extremism of right or left. \nTheresa May's Tory party acts increasingly like Blukip as she pursues a Hard Brexit that could do long-term damage to our economy and our communities. And, under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour is simply not up to the task. \nThis is why I urge you to support the Liberal Democrats at this election. Every vote we gain nationally is a vote for an outward-looking, confident, optimistic future. \nTo the communities feeling ignored and rejected I would say this: no party works harder to get your views heard. As a Rothwell councillor, and leader of the Liberal Democrats on Leeds City Council, this has always been my driving force."
