                "content": "Dear Friend,\n\nThe referendum result was bad enough.\n\nBut when I saw Labour MPs join with UKIP and the Conservatives to vote for a damaging hard Brexit, it felt even worse.\n\nThis isn't what I want for my children or my country.\n\nIsolation isn't good for Britain. Being outside the single market isn't good for Britain. Ignoring the damage that hard Brexit does to jobs, food prices and industry isn't good for Britain.\n\nThis election is our chance to get the strong opposition Britain needs.\n\nThat's why I'm asking you to support the Liberal Democrats this time. The fight to stop a hard Brexit isn't over. The people, not Theresa May, can and should have the final say on the Brexit deal in a referendum.\n\nThat's what we\u2019ll be fighting for with your support.\n\nA vote for the Lib Dems is also a vote to stop more harsh cuts to our NHS and our schools. It's a vote against heartless cuts to benefits for bereaved families.\n\nWhen Labour had the chance to stand up to this Government on Brexit they failed. I thought the Labour Party shared our values of openness and tolerance - but instead they've left many of their supporters feeling angry and betrayed.\n\nPlease join with me and help change Britain's future in this election.\n\nThanks and best wishes,\nTim Farron\n\nTim Farron\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats\n\nPS I'd love to hear your views on Brexit and other issues. Please do complete the enclosed survey."
