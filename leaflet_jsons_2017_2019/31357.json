Boris Johnson has made matters worse by suspending parliament for five weeks, leaving me no doubt that he wants to take us straight off a cliff edge with no intervention, whether that edge resulted from a referendum, consented by that vote to such a catastrophic and reckless course of action. That is why, with many colleagues in all parties, I voted to seize control of the parliamentary agenda and propose legislation which would prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31st. We succeeded in this, and legislation followed which has now passed all its stages in Parliament. It requires the Prime Minister either to put a new deal to the House and to the European Council of Ministers in mid October or if not to ask the EU for a further extension so that a satisfactory deal can be agreed. It is clear now that we will be having a General Election at some point in the near future and I would welcome that, as we need a change of government because so many of the issues our country is facing under a Conservative government and break the Brexit deadlock."

                "content": "The problem with this is, that if a date for an election is agreed before the end of 31st October, it is within the gift of the Prime Minister, once the dissolution of parliament has been agreed, to change the date and take the UK out of the EU with no deal whilst the rest of us are out campaigning. Another way for us to get beyond the current deadlock is of course to have a second referendum and ask people whether they would accept a no deal Brexit, or whether knowing what is entailed would much rather stay in the EU? I think this would be a wise course of action and in this circumstance would campaign for Remain."
