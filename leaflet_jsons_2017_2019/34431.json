I have worked in the NHS for 36 years, working hard to tackle health inequality. Since the Tories came to power nearly 10 years ago my job has got harder. Cuts to the NHS has put huge pressure on resources putting up waiting times in A&E, for a GP and cancer treatment. Labour's NHS Rescue Plan will restore the nursing bursary and recruit the thousands of doctors and nurses we need to end the Tory NHS crisis. Labour would also focus on prevention measures to stop people getting sick and tackle health inequalities and prioritise children\u2019s health and wellbeing. Lots of people think Brexit is the only thing that matters at this election, but there\u2019s any number of other issues at stake too. Please think about the future of the NHS when you cast your vote on 12 December."
