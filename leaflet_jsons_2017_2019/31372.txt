        "content": "Politics is in crisis. Brexit has dominated the headlines and ten years of Tory rule and austerity have divided our communities. It's no surprise that people have lost faith in the politicians that are there to serve them. I believe in doing politics differently; honest, tough and delivered from the heart. For me, my commitment to Broxtowe runs deep. I've lived here all my life. My family are here. My children are here. My roots are here. It is in Broxtowe where I have served as a Councillor for the last eleven years and it is in Broxtowe where I am Vice Chair of Governors for our local secondary schools. I have given my life to our community and I want to give that same passion and dedication to representing you in Parliament. My record of community action here in Broxtowe means that I've always listened to and held the people in power to account. Our next MP needs to be someone you can trust. It isn't a job for life, or a career choice. It is a real privilege to represent others; to serve, to fight and to stand up for what people believe in. I love Broxtowe. It is my home. I will never let you down."
