People had water companies and energy owned managed for profits, Labour will keep them public.\n\nYou can trust Labour with our NHS - our universal healthcare on the basis of need not ability to pay. We will not let Donald Trump get his hands on it.\n\nIf you want to live in a society which works for everyone, if you want to save our hospitals, schools and public services, if you want an economy that works for all not just the privileged few; if you want to put an end to climate disasters and air pollution, vote for real change and reinvest our Environment. Vote Labour Thursday 12 December."
