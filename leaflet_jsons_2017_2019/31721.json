This makes a real difference to the lives of local people in so many ways. If elected again as your MP, I am determined to continue to work with residents to make a positive difference. I am also determined to continue to debate politics with courtesy and kindness. Alienating others in this way risks inhibiting progress, whilst some of the most effective work I have been privileged to be engaged in has been cross-party, such as tackling human trafficking, addressing environmental concerns, promoting human rights, tackling addiction, and strengthening family life. I believe politicians serve people best when they resist engaging in personal insults and commit to civility in our political discourse."
