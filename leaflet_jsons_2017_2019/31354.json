It means we can get on with building a fairer, greener, more caring Britain, forced to rely on foodbanks. It means taking the billion-pound trade auction on the NHS off the table. It means keeping the benefits of EU membership and having a strong influence on international issues. That is why I am fighting to Stop Brexit.' Kamran said: 'Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is bankrolled by those who want to make billions from the destruction of our country.' The Lib Dems do not want to see our public services turned to profit. We want to build a brighter future where people are prioritised over profits whilst wrangling about leaving the EU. This is why I am fighting to STOP BREXIT."
