Like many others, I think the cuts to our schools, hospitals and social care are causing real pressure and hardship. We should be investing in these vital services. This is why we pay our taxes: so that everyone can have the health and social care they need, so that all our children and young people can receive a quality education and achieve their maximum potential. There are other parties who will say 'Don't waste your vote.' For me, a wasted vote is when you use it to vote for someone or something you don't want or truly believe in. If you believe in protecting the environment for our children, fighting for our NHS, and want a fairer and more just society, please don't waste your vote: Vote Green Party on June 8th."
