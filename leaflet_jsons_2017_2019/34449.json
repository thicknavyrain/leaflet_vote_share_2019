Born and bred in Nottingham, growing up in a single-parent household under austerity, I understand the daily injustices that we face. Under a Tory government, we've seen rents rise, wages stagnate, and our schools and hospitals reach breaking point. And as a local hate crime worker, I know that our communities need to be healed and empowered by a better project. It's time for real change. For me, politics was never about prestige and personal ambition. For too long, we've been ignored by Westminster. As your MP, I will be accessible and accountable to you; I will continue living in Nottingham, hold frequent surgeries, and take only the average UK full-time wage of \u00a335,000 \u2013 donating the rest to local causes."
